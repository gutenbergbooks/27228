PREFACE
</center>

<p>This work is a contribution to light literature, and to the literature of light.
Though a monograph, it is also a medley.</p>

<p>The first part is mythological and mirthsome. It is the original nucleus around which
the other parts have gathered. Some years since, the writer was led to investigate the
world-wide myth of the Man in the Moon, in its legendary and ludicrous aspects; and one
study being a stepping-stone to another, the ball was enlarged as it rolled.</p>

<p>The second part, dealing with moon-worship, is designed to show that anthropomorphism
and sexuality have been the principal factors in that idolatry which in all ages has paid
homage to the hosts of heaven, as <i>heaved</i> above the aspiring worshipper. Man adores
what he regards as higher than he. And if the moon is supposed to affect his tides, that
body becomes his water-god.</p>

<p>The third part treats of lunar superstitions, many of which yet live in the vagaries
which sour and shade our modern sweetness and light.</p>

<p>The fourth and final part is a literary essay on lunar inhabitation, presenting <i>in
nuce</i> the present state of the enigma of "the plurality of worlds."</p>

<p>Of the imperfections of his production the author is partly conscious. Not
<i>wholly</i> so; for others see us often more advantageously than we see ourselves. But
a hope is cherished that this work--a compendium of lunar literature in its least
scientific branches--may win a welcome which shall constitute the worker's richest
reward. To the innumerable writers who are quoted, the indebtedness felt is
inexpressible.</p><br>

<a name="I" id="I"></a>MOON SPOTS.
</center><br>
<a name="I1" id="I1"></a>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION.

<p>With the invention of the telescope came an epoch in human history. To Hans
Lippershey, a Dutch optician, is accorded the honour of having constructed the first
astronomical telescope, which he made so early as the 2nd of October, 1608. Galileo,
hearing of this new wonder, set to work, and produced and improved instrument, which he
carried in triumph to Venice, where it occasioned the intensest delight. Sir David
Brewster tells us that "the interest which the exhibition of the telescope excited at
Venice did not soon subside: Sirturi describes it as amounting to frenzy. When he himself
had succeeded in making one of these instruments, he ascended the tower of St. Mark,
where he might use it without molestation. He was recognised, however, by a crowd in the
street, and such was the eagerness of their curiosity, that they took possession of the
wondrous tube, and detained the impatient philosopher for several hours till they had
successively witnessed its effects."&nbsp;<a href="#note001"><u>[1]</u></a> it was in
May, 1609, that Galileo turned his telescope on the moon. "The first observations of
Galileo," says Flammarion, "did not make less noise than the discovery of America; many
saw in them another discovery of a new world much more interesting than America, as it
was beyond the earth. It is one of the most curious episodes of history, that of the
prodigious excitement which was caused by the unveiling of the world of the
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note002"><u>[2]</u></a> Nor are we astonished at their astonishment
when they beheld mountains which have since been found to be from 15,000 to 26,000 feet
in height--highlands of the moon indeed--far higher in proportion to the moon's
diameter than any elevations on the earth; when they saw the surface of the satellite
scooped out into deep valleys, or spread over with vast walled plains from 130 to 140
miles across. No wonder that the followers of Aristotle resented the explosion of their
preconceived beliefs; for their master had taught that the moon was perfectly spherical
and smooth, and that the spots were merely reflections of our own mountains. Other
ancient philosophers had said that these patches were shadows of opaque bodies floating
between the sun and the moon. But to the credit of Democritus be it remembered that he
propounded the opinion that the spots were diversities or inequalities upon the lunar
surface; and thus anticipated by twenty centuries the disclosures of the telescope. The
invention of this invaluable appliance we have regarded as marking a great modern epoch;
and what is usually written on the moon is mainly a summary of results obtained through
telescopic observation, aided by other apparatus, and conducted by learned men. We now
purpose to go back to the ages when there were neither reflectors nor refractors in
existence; and to travel beyond the bounds of ascertained fact into the regions of
fiction, where abide the shades of superstition and the dreamy forms of myth. Having
promised a contribution to light literature, we shall give to fancy a free rein, and levy
taxes upon poets and story-tellers, wits and humorists wherever they may be of service.
Much will have to be said, in the first place, of the man in the moon, whom we must view
as he has been manifested in the mask of mirth, and also in the mirror of mythology. Then
we shall present the woman in the moon, who is less known than the immortal man. Next a
hare will be started; afterwards a frog, and other objects; and when we reach the end of
our excursion, if we mistake not, it will be confessed that the moon has created more
merriment, more marvel, and more mystery, than all of the other orbs taken together.</p>

<p>But before we forget the fair moon in the society of its famous man, let us soothe our
spirits in sweet oblivion of discussions and dissertations, while we survey its argentine
glories with poetic rapture. Like Shelley, we are all in love with</p>

<blockquote>
"That orb&egrave;d maiden, with white fire laden,<br>
Whom mortals call the moon." (<i>The Cloud</i>.)
</blockquote>

<p>Our little loves, who take the lowest seats in the domestic synagogue, if they cannot
have the moon by crying for it, will rush out, when they ought to be in bed, and
chant,</p>

<blockquote>
"Boys and girls come out to play,<br>
The moon doth shine as bright as day."
</blockquote>

<p>The young ladies of the family, without a tincture of affectation, will languish as
they gaze on the lovely Luna. Not, as a grumpy, grisly old bear of a bachelor once said,
"Because there's a man in it!" No; the precious pets are fond of moonlight rather because
they are the daughters of Eve. They are in sympathy with all that is bright and beautiful
in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath; and it has even been suspected that the
only reason why they ever assume that invisible round-about called crinoline is that,
like the moon, they may move in a circle. Our greatest men, likewise, are susceptible to
Luna's blandishments. In proof of this we may produce a story told by Mark Lemon, at one
time the able editor of Punch. By the way, an irrepressible propensity to play upon words
has reminded some one that punch is always improved by the essence of lemon. But this we
leave to the bibulous, and go on with the story. Lord Brougham, speaking of the salary
attached to a new judgeship, said it was all moonshine. Lord Lyndhurst, in his dry and
waggish way, remarked, "May be so, my Lord Harry; but I have a strong notion that,
moonshine though it be, you would like to see the <i>first quarter</i> of
it."&nbsp;<a href="#note003"><u>[3]</u></a> That Hibernian was a discriminating admirer
of the moon who said that the sun was a coward, because he always went away as soon as it
began to grow dark, and never came back till it was light again; while the blessed moon
stayed with us through the forsaken night. And now, feeling refreshed with these
exhilarating meditations, we, for awhile, leave this lovable orb to those astronomical
stars who have studied the heavens from their earliest history; and hasten to make
ourselves acquainted with the proper study of mankind, the ludicrous and legendary lunar
man.</p><br>
<a name="I2" id="I2"></a>II. THE MAN IN THE MOON.

<p>We must not be misunderstood. By the man in the moon we do not mean any public tavern,
or gin-palace, displaying that singular sign. The last inn of that name known to us in
London stands in a narrow passage of that fashionable promenade called Regent Street,
close to Piccadilly. Nor do we intend by the man in the moon the silvery individual who
pays the election expenses, so long as the elector votes his ticket. Neither do we mean
the mooney, or mad fellow who is too fond of the cup which cheers and then inebriates;
nor even one who goes mooning round the world without a plan or purpose. No; if we are
not too scientific, we are too straightforward to be allured by any such false lights as
these. By the man in the moon we mean none other than that illustrious personage, whose
shining countenance may be beheld many a night, clouds and fogs permitting, beaming
good-naturedly on the dark earth, and singing, in the language of a lyric bard,</p>

<blockquote>
"The moon is out to-night, love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet me with a smile."
</blockquote>

<p>But some sceptic may assail us with a note of interrogation, saying, "Is there a man
in the moon?" "Why, of course, there is!" Those who have misgivings should ask a sailor;
he knows, for the punsters assure us that he has been to <i>sea</i>. Or let them ask any
<i>lunatic</i>; he should know, for he has been so <i>struck</i> with his acquaintance,
that he has adopted the man's name. Or ask any little girl in the nursery, and she will
recite, with sweet simplicity, how</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man in the moon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came down too soon,<br>
And asked the way to Norwich."
</blockquote>

<p>The darling may not understand why he sought that venerable city, nor whether he ever
arrived there, but she knows very well that</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went by the south,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burnt his mouth<br>
With eating hot pease porridge."
</blockquote>

<p>But it is useless to inquire of any stupid joker, for he will idly say that there is
no such man there, because, forsooth, a certain single woman who was sent to the moon
came back again, which she would never have done if a man had been there with whom she
could have married and remained, Nor should any one be misled by those blind guides who
darkly hint that it is all moonshine. There is not an Indian moonshee, nor a citizen of
the Celestial Empire, some of whose ancestors came from the nocturnal orb, who does not
know better than that. Perhaps the wisest course is to inquire within. Have not we all
frequently affirmed that we knew no more about certain inscrutable matters than the man
in the moon? Now we would never have committed ourselves to such a comparison had we not
been sure that the said man was a veritable and creditable, though somewhat uninstructed
person. But our feelings ought not to be wrought upon in this way. We "had rather be a
dog, and bay the moon, than such a Roman" as is not at least distantly acquainted with
that brilliant character in high life who careers so conspicuously amid the
constellations which constitute the upper ten thousand of super-mundane society. And now
some inquisitive individual may be impatient to interrupt our eloquence with the
question, "What are you going to make of the man in the moon?" Well, we are not going to
make anything of him. For, first, he is a man; therefore incapable of improvement.
Secondly, he is in the moon, and that is out of our reach.[*] All that we can promise just
now is, to furnish a few particulars of the man himself; some account of calls which he
is reported to have made to his friends here below; and also some account of visits which
his friends on earth have paid him in return.</p>

<p>[*] Besides, as old John Lilly says in the prologue to his <i>Endymion</i> (1591),
"There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone."</p>

<p>We know something of his residence, whenever he is at home: what do we know of the
man? We have been annoyed at finding his lofty name desecrated to base uses. If
"imagination may trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a
bung-hole," literature traces the man in the moon, and discovers him pressed into the
meanest services. Our readers need not be disquieted with details; though our own
equanimity has been sorely disturbed as we have seen scribblers dragging from the skies a
"name at which the world grows pale, to point a moral, or adorn a tale." Political
squibs, paltry chapbooks, puny satires, and penny imbecilities, too numerous for mention
here, with an occasional publication of merit, have been printed and sold at the expense
of the man in the moon. For the sake of the curious we place the titles and dates of some
of these in an appendix and pass on. We have not learned very many particulars relating
to the domestic habits or personal character of the man in the moon, consequently our
smallest biographical contributions will be thankfully received. We must not be pressed
for his photograph, at present. We certainly wish it could have been procured; but though
photography has taken some splendid views of the</p>

THE MAN IN THE MOON

</center><br>

<p>face of the moon, it has not yet produced any perfect picture of the physiognomy of
the man. It should always be borne in mind that, as Stilpo says in the old play of
<i>Timon</i>, written about 1600, "The man in the moone is not in the moone
superficially, although he bee in the moone (as the Greekes will have it) catapodially,
specificatively, and quidditatively."&nbsp;<a href="#note004"><u>[4]</u></a> This
beautiful language, let us explain for the behoof of any foreign reader, simply means
that he is not always where we can get at him; and therefore his venerable visage is
missing from our celestial portrait gallery. One fact we have found out, which we fear
will ripple the pure water placidity of some of our best friends; but the truth must be
told.</p>

<blockquote>
"Our man in the moon drinks clarret,<br>
With powder-beef, turnep, and carret.<br>
If he doth so, why should not you<br>
Drink until the sky looks blew?"&nbsp;<a href="#note005"><u>[5]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Another old ballad runs:</p>

<blockquote>
"The man in the moon drinks claret,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is a dull Jack-a-Dandy;<br>
Would he know a sheep's head from a carrot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He should learn to drink cyder and brandy."
</blockquote>

<p>In a <i>Jest Book of the Seventeenth Century</i> we came across the following story:
"A company of gentlemen coming into a tavern, whose signe was the Moone, called for a
quart of sacke. The drawer told them they had none; whereat the gentlemen wondring were
told by the drawer that the man in the moon always drunke claret."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note006"><u>[6]</u></a> Several astronomers assert the absence of water in the moon; if
this be the case, what is the poor man to drink? Still, it is an unsatisfactory
announcement to us all; for we are afraid that it is the claret which makes him look so
red in the face sometimes when he is full, and gets a little fogged. We have ourselves

only hope that he imbibes nothing stronger, though it is said that moonlight is but
another name for smuggled spirits. The lord of Cynthia must not be too hastily suspected,
for, at most, the moon fills her horn but once a month. Still, the earth itself being so
invariably sober, its satellite, like Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion. We
therefore hope that our lunar hero may yet take a ribbon of sky-blue from the milky way,
and become a staunch abstainer; if only for example's sake.</p>

<p>as the magnificent Milton has it. His tobacco must be bird's-eye, as he takes a
bird's-eye view of things; and his pipe is presumably a meer-sham, whence his "sable
clouds turn forth their silver lining on the night." Smoking, without doubt, is a bad
practice, especially when the clay is choked or the weed is worthless; but fuming against
smokers we take to be infinitely worse.</p>

<p>We are better pleased to learn that the man in the moon is a poet. Possibly some
uninspired groveller, who has never climbed Parnassus, nor drunk of the Castalian spring,
may murmur that this is very likely, for that all poetry is "moonstruck madness." Alas if
such an antediluvian barbarian be permitted to "revisit thus the glimpses of the moon,
making night hideous" as he mutters his horrid blasphemy! We, however, take a nobler view
of the matter. To us the music of the spheres is exalting as it is exalted; and the music
of earth is a "sphere-descended maid, friend of pleasure, wisdom's aid." We are therefore
disposed to hear the following lines, which have been handed down for publication. Their
title is autobiographical, and, for that reason, they are slightly egotistical.</p>

<blockquote>
"A SHREWD OLD FELLOW'S THE MAN IN THE MOON."<br>
<br>
"From my palace of light I look down upon earth,<br>
When the tiny stars are twinkling round me;<br>
Though centuries old, I am now as bright<br>
As when at my birth Old Adam found me.<br>
Oh! the strange sights that I have seen,<br>
Since earth first wore her garment of green!<br>
King after king has been toppled down,<br>
And red-handed anarchy's worn the crown!<br>
From the world that's beneath me I crave not a boon,<br>
For a shrewd old fellow's the Man in the Moon.<br>
And I looked on 'mid the watery strife,<br>
When the world was deluged and all was lost<br>
Save one blessed vessel, preserver of life,<br>
Which rode on through safety, though tempest tost.<br>
I have seen crime clothed in ermine and gold,<br>
And virtue shuddering in winter's cold.<br>
I have seen the hypocrite blandly smile,<br>
While straightforward honesty starved the while.<br>
Oh! the strange sights that I have seen,<br>
Since earth first wore her garment of green!<br>
I have gazed on the coronet decking the brow<br>
Of the villain who, breathing affection's vow,<br>
Hath poisoned the ear of the credulous maiden,<br>
Then left her to pine with heart grief laden.<br>
Oh! oh! if this, then, be the world, say I,<br>
I'll keep to my home in the clear blue sky;<br>
Still to dwell in my planet I crave as a boon,<br>
For the earth ne'er will do for the Man in the Moon."&nbsp;<a href=

<p>This effusion is not excessively flattering to our "great globe," and "all which it
inherit"; and we surmise that the author was in a misanthropic mood when it was written.
Yet it is serviceable sometimes to see ourselves as others see us. On the other hand, we
have but little liking for those who "hope to merit heaven by making earth a hell," in
any sense. We prefer to believe that the tide is rising though the waves recede, and that
our dark world is waxing towards the full-orbed glory "to which the whole creation
moves."</p>

<p>Here for the present we part company with the man in the moon as material for
amusement, that we may track him through the mythic maze, where, in well-nigh every
language, he has left some traces of his existence. As there is a side of the moon which
we have never seen, and according to Laplace never shall see, there is also an aspect of
the matter in hand that remains to be traversed, if we would circumambulate its entire
extent. Our subject must now be viewed in the magic mirror of mythology. The antiquarian
Ritson shall state the question to be brought before our honourable house of inquiry. He
denominates the man in the moon "an imaginary being, the subject of perhaps one of the
most ancient, as well as one of the most popular, superstitions of the
world."&nbsp;<a href="#note008"><u>[8]</u></a> And as we must explore the vestiges of
antiquity, Asiatic and European, African and American, and even Polynesian, we bespeak
patient forbearance and attention. One little particular we may partly clear up at once,
though it will meet us again in another connection. It will serve as a sidelight to our
legendary scenes. In English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek, the moon is feminine;
but in all the Teutonic tongues the moon is masculine. Which of the twain is its true
gender? We go back to the Sanskrit for an answer. Professor Max M&uuml;ller rightly says,
"It is no longer denied that for throwing light on some of the darkest problems that have
to be solved by the student of language, nothing is so useful as a critical study of
Sanskrit."&nbsp;<a href="#note009"><u>[9]</u></a> Here the word for the moon is
<i>m&acirc;s</i>, which is masculine. Mark how even what Hamlet calls "words, words,
words" lend their weight and value to the adjustment of this great argument. The very
moon is masculine, and, like Wordsworth's child, is "father of the man."</p>

<p>If a bisexous moon seem an anomaly, perhaps the suggestion of Jamieson will account
for the hermaphrodism: "The moon, it has been said, was viewed as of the masculine gender
in respect of the earth, whose husband he was supposed to be; but as a female in relation
to the sun, as being his spouse."&nbsp;<a href="#note010"><u>[10]</u></a> Here, also, we
find a clue to the origin of this myth. If modern science, discovering the moon's
inferiority to the sun, call the former feminine, ancient nescience, supposing the sun to
be inferior to the moon, called the latter masculine. The sun, incomparable in splendour,
invariable in aspect and motion, to the unaided eye immaculate in surface, too dazzling
to permit prolonged observation, and shining in the daytime, when the mind was occupied
with the duties of pastoral, agricultural, or commercial life, was to the ancient simply
an object of wonder as a glory, and of worship as a god. The moon, on the contrary, whose
mildness of lustre enticed attention, whose phases were an embodiment of change, whose
strange spots seemed shadowy pictures of things and beings terrestrial, whose appearance
amid the darkness of night was so welcome, and who came to men susceptible, from the
influences of quiet and gloom, of superstitious imaginings, from the very beginning grew
into a familiar spirit of kindred form with their own, and though regarded as the
subordinate and wife of the sun, was reverenced as the superior and husband of the earth.
With the transmission of this myth began its transmutation. From the moon being a man, it
became a man's abode: with some it was the world whence human spirits came; with others
it was the final home whither human spirits returned. Then it grew into a penal colony,
to which egregious offenders were transported; or prison cage, in which, behind bars of
light, miserable sinners were to be exposed to all eternity, as a warning to the
excellent of the earth. One thing is certain, namely, that, during some phases, the
moon's surface strikingly resembles a man's countenance. We usually represent the sun and
the moon with the faces of men; and in the latter case the task is not difficult. Some
would say that the moon is so drawn to reproduce some lunar deity: it would be more
correct to say that the lunar deity was created through this human likeness. Sir Thomas
Browne remarks, "The sun and moon are usually described with human faces: whether herein
there be not a pagan imitation, and those visages at first implied Apollo and Diana, we
may make some doubt."&nbsp;<a href="#note011"><u>[11]</u></a> Brand, in quoting
Browne, adds, &quot;Butler asks a shrewd question on this head, which I do not
remember to have seen solved:--</p>

<blockquote>
"Tell me but what's the natural cause,<br>
Why on a Sign no Painter draws<br>
The <i>Full Moon</i> ever, but the <i>Half</i>?"<br>
(Hudibras, B. II., c. iii.)&nbsp;<a href="#note012"><u>[12]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Another factor in the formation of our moon-myth was the anthropomorphism which sees
something manlike in everything, not only in the anthropoid apes, where we may find a
resemblance more faithful than flattering, but also in the mountains and hills, rivers
and seas of earth, and in the planets and constellations of heaven. Anthropomorphism was
but a species of personification, which also metamorphosed the firmament into a menagerie
of lions and bears, with a variety of birds, beasts, and fishes. Dr. Wagner writes: "The
sun, moon, and stars, clouds and mists, storms and tempests, appeared to be higher
powers, and took distinct forms in the imagination of man. As the phenomena of nature
seemed to resemble animals either in outward form or in action, they were represented
under the figure of animals."&nbsp;<a href="#note013"><u>[13]</u></a> Sir George W. Cox
points out how phrases ascribing to things so named the actions or feelings of living
beings, "would grow into stories which might afterwards be woven together, and so furnish
the groundwork of what we call a legend or a romance. This will become plain, if we take
the Greek sayings or myths about Endymion and Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;. Here, besides these two
names, we have the names Protogenia and Asterodia. But every Greek knew that
Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc; was a name for the moon, which was also described as Asterodia because
she has her path among the stars, and that Protogenia denoted the first or early born
morning. Now Protogenia was the mother of Endymion, while Asterodia was his wife; and so
far the names were transparent. Had all the names remained so, no myth, in the strict
sense of the word, could have sprung up; but as it so happened, the meaning of the name
Endymion, as denoting the sun, when he is about to plunge or dive into the sea, had been
forgotten, and thus Endymion became a beautiful youth with whom the moon fell in love,
and whom she came to look upon as he lay in profound sleep in the cave of
Latmos."&nbsp;<a href="#note014"><u>[14]</u></a> To this growth and transformation of
myths we may return after awhile; meanwhile we will follow closely our man in the moon,
who, among the Greeks, was the young Endymion, the beloved of Diana, who held the
shepherd passionately in her embrace. This fable probably arose from Endymion's love of
astronomy, a predilection common in ancient pastors. He was, no doubt, an ardent admirer
of the moon; and soon it was reported that Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc; courted and caressed him in
return. May such chaste enjoyment be ours also! We may remark, in passing, that classic
tales are pure or impure, very much according to the taste of the reader. "To the
jaundiced all things seem yellow," say the French; and Paul said, "To the pure all things
are pure: but unto them that are defiled is nothing pure." According to Serapion, as
quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus, the tradition was that the face which appears in the moon
is the soul of a Sibyl. Plutarch, in his treatise, <i>Of the Face appearing in the
roundle of the Moone</i>, cites the poet Agesinax as saying of that orb,</p>

<blockquote>
"All roundabout environed<br>
With fire she is illumined:<br>
And in the middes there doth appeere,<br>
Like to some boy, a visage cleere;<br>
Whose eies to us doe seem in view,<br>
Of colour grayish more than blew:<br>
The browes and forehead tender seeme,<br>
The cheeks all reddish one would deeme."&nbsp;<a href="#note015"><u>[15]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The story of the man in the moon as told in our British nurseries is supposed to be
founded on Biblical fact. But though the Jews have a Talmudic tradition that Jacob is in
the moon, and though they believe that his face is plainly visible, the Hebrew Scriptures
make no mention of the myth. Yet to our fireside auditors it is related that a man was
found by Moses gathering sticks on the Sabbath, and that for this crime he was
transferred to the moon, there to remain till the end of all things. The passage cited in
support of this tale is <i>Numbers</i> xv. 32-36. Upon referring to the sacred text, we
certainly find a man gathering sticks upon the Sabbath day, and the congregation
gathering stones for his merciless punishment, but we look in vain for any mention of the
moon. <i>Non est inventus</i>. Of many an ancient story-teller we may say, as Sheridan
said of Dundas, "the right honourable gentleman is indebted to his memory for his jests
and to his imagination for his facts."</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor reminds us that "according to German nurses, the day was not the Sabbath,
but Sunday. Their tale runs as follows: Ages ago there went one Sunday an old man into
the woods to hew sticks. He cut a faggot and slung it on a stout staff, cast it over his
shoulder, and began to trudge home with his burthen. On his way he met a handsome man in
Sunday suit, walking towards the church. The man stopped, and asked the faggot-bearer,
'Do you know that this is Sunday on earth, when all must rest from their labours?'
'Sunday on earth, or Monday in heaven, it's all one to me!' laughed the woodcutter. 'Then
bear your bundle for ever!' answered the stranger. 'And as you value not Sunday on earth,
yours shall</p>

</center><br>

<p>be a perpetual moon-day in heaven; you shall stand for eternity in the moon, a warning
to all Sabbath-breakers.' Thereupon the stranger vanished, and the man was caught up with
his staff and faggot into the moon, where he stands yet."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note016"><u>[16]</u></a></p>

<p>In Tobler's account the man was given the choice of burning in the sun, or of freezing
in the moon; and preferring a lunar frost to a solar furnace, he is to be seen at full
moon seated with his bundle of sticks on his back. If "the cold in clime are cold in
blood," we may be thankful that we do not hibernate eternally in the moon and in the
nights of winter, when the cold north winds blow," we may look up through the casement
and "pity the sorrows of this poor old man."</p>

<p>Mr. Baring-Gould finds that "in Schaumberg-lippe, the story goes, that a man and a
woman stand in the moon: the man because he strewed brambles and thorns on the church
path, so as to hinder people from attending mass on Sunday morning; the woman because she
made butter on that day. The man carries his bundle of thorns, the woman her butter tub.
A similar tale is told in Swabia and in Marken. Fischart says that there 'is to be seen
in the moon a mannikin who stole wood'; and Praetorius, in his description of the world,
that 'superstitious people assert that the black flecks in the moon are a man who
gathered wood on a Sabbath, and is therefore turned into stone.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note017"><u>[17]</u></a></p>

<p>The North Frisians, among the most ancient and pure of all the German tribes, tell the
tale differently. "At the time when wishing was of avail, a man, one Christmas Eve, stole
cabbages from his neighbour's garden. When just in the act of walking off with his load,
he was perceived by the people, who conjured (wished) him up in the moon. There he stands
in the full moon, to be seen by everybody, bearing his load of cabbages to all eternity.
Every Christmas Eve he is said to turn round once. Others say that he stole
willow-boughs, which he must bear for ever. In Sylt the story goes that he was a
sheep-stealer, that enticed sheep to him with a bundle of cabbages, until, as an
everlasting warning to others, he was placed in the moon, where he constantly holds in
his hand a bundle of cabbages. The people of Rantum say that he is a giant, who at the
time of the flow stands in a stooping posture, because he is then taking up water, which
he pours out on the earth, and thereby causes the flow; but at the time of the ebb he
stands erect and rests from his labour, when the water can subside again."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note018"><u>[18]</u></a></p>

<p>Crossing the sea into Scandinavia, we obtain some valuable information. First, we find
that in the old Norse, or language of the ancient Scandinavians, the sun is always
feminine, and the moon masculine. In the <i>V&ouml;lu-Sp&aacute;</i>, a grand,
prophetic poem, it is written--</p>

<blockquote>
"But the sun had not yet learned to trace<br>
The path that conducts to her dwelling-place<br>
To the moon arrived was not the hour<br>
When he should exert his mystic power<br>
Nor to the stars was the knowledge given,<br>
To marshal their ranks o'er the fields of heaven."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note019"><u>[19]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>We also learn that "the moon and the sun are brother and sister; they are the children
of Mundilf&ouml;ri, who, on account of their beauty, called his son M&acirc;ni, and his
daughter S&ocirc;l." Here again we observe that the moon is masculine. "M&acirc;ni
directs the course of the moon, and regulates Nyi (the new moon) and Nithi (the waning
moon). He once took up two children from the earth, Bil and Hiuki, as they were going
from the well of Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the bucket Soeg, and the pole
Simul."&nbsp;<a href="#note020"><u>[20]</u></a> These two children, with their pole and
bucket, were placed in the moon, "where they could be seen from earth"; which phrase must
refer to the lunar spots. Thorpe, speaking of the allusion in the <i>Edda</i> to these
spots, says that they "require but little illustration. Here they are children carrying
water in a bucket, a superstition still preserved in the popular belief of the
Swedes."&nbsp;<a href="#note021"><u>[21]</u></a> We are all reminded at once of
the nursery rhyme--</p>

<blockquote>
"Jack and Jill went up the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fetch a pail of water;<br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jill came tumbling after."
</blockquote>

<p>Little have we thought, when rehearsing this jingle in our juvenile hours, that we
should some day discover its roots in one of the oldest mythologies of the world. But
such is the case. Mr. Baring-Gould has evolved the argument in a manner which, if not
absolutely conclusive in each point, is extremely cogent and clear. "This verse, which to
us seems at first sight nonsense, I have no hesitation in saying has a high antiquity,
and refers to the Eddaic Hjuki and Bil. The names indicate as much. Hjuki, in Norse,
would be pronounced Juki, which would readily become Jack; and Bil, for the sake of
euphony and in order to give a female name to one of the children, would become Jill. The
fall of Jack, and the subsequent fall of Jill, simply represent the vanishing of one moon
spot after another, as the moon wanes. But the old Norse myth had a deeper signification
than merely an explanation of the moon spots. Hjuki is derived from the verb jakka, to
heap or pile together, to assemble and increase; and Bil, from bila, to break up or
dissolve. Hjuki and Bil, therefore, signify nothing more than the waxing and waning of
the moon, and the water they are represented as bearing signifies the fact that the
rainfall depends on the phases of the moon. Waxing and waning were individualized, and
the meteorological fact of the connection of the rain with the moon was represented by
the children as water-bearers. But though Jack and Jill became by degrees dissevered in
the popular mind from the moon, the original myth went through a fresh phase, and exists
still under a new form. The Norse superstition attributed <i>theft</i> to the moon, and
the vulgar soon began to believe that the figure they saw in the moon was the thief. The
lunar specks certainly may be made to resemble one figure, but only a lively imagination
can discern two. The girl soon dropped out of popular mythology, the boy oldened into a
venerable man, he retained his pole, and the bucket was transformed into the thing he had
stolen--sticks or vegetables. The theft was in some places exchanged for
Sabbath-breaking, especially among those in Protestant countries who were acquainted with
the Bible story of the stick-gatherer."&nbsp;<a href="#note022"><u>[22]</u></a></p>

<p>The German Grimm, who was by no means a grim German, but a very genial story-teller,
also maintains this transformation of the original myth. "Plainly enough the water-pole
of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into
the thornbush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the
keeping of the Christian holiday, the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting
firewood, as because he did it on a Sunday."&nbsp;<a href="#note023"><u>[23]</u></a>
Manifestly "Jack and Jill went up the hill" is more than a Runic rhyme, and like many
more of our popular strains might supply us with a most interesting and instructive
entertainment; but we must hasten on with the moon-man.</p>

<p>We come next to Britain. Alexander Neckam, a learned English abbot, poet, and scholar,
born in St. Albans, in 1157, in commenting on the dispersed shadow in the moon, thus
alluded to the vulgar belief: "Nonne novisti quid vulgus vocet rusticum in luna portantem
spinas? Unde quidam vulgariter loquens ait,</p>

<blockquote>
Rusticus in Luna<br>
Quem sarcina deprimit una<br>
Monstrat per spinas<br>
Nulli prodesse rapinas."&nbsp;<a href="#note024"><u>[24]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be rendered, "Do you not know what the people call the rustic in the moon who
carries the thorns? Whence one vulgarly speaking says,</p>

<blockquote>
The Rustic in the moon,<br>
Whose burden weighs him down,<br>
This changeless truth reveals,<br>
He profits not who steals."
</blockquote>

<p>Thomas Wright considers Neckam's Latin version of this popular distich "very curious,
as being the earliest allusion we have to the popular legend of the man in the moon." We
are specially struck with the reference to theft; while no less noteworthy is the absence
of that sabbatarianism, which is the "moral" of the nursery tale.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is a manuscript of English poetry of the thirteenth
century, containing an old song composed probably about the middle of that century. It
was first printed by Ritson in his <i>Ancient Songs</i>, the earliest edition of which
was published in London, in 1790. The first lines are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
"Mon in the mone stond ant strit,<br>
On is bot-forke is burthen he bereth<br>
Hit is muche wonder that he na down slyt,<br>
For doute leste he valle he shoddreth and shereth."&nbsp;<a href=

<p>In the <i>Archaeological Journal</i> we are presented with a relic from the fourteenth
century. "Mr. Hudson Taylor submitted to the Committee a drawing of an impression of a
very remarkable personal seal, here represented of the full size. It is appended to a
deed (preserved in the Public Record Office) dated in the ninth year of Edward the Third,
whereby Walter de Grendene, clerk, sold to Margaret, his mother, one messuage, a barn and
four acres of ground in the parish of Kingston-on-Thames. The device appears to be
founded on the ancient popular legend that a husbandman who had stolen a bundle of thorns
from a hedge was, in punishment of his theft, carried up to the moon. The legend reading
<i>Te Waltere docebo cur spinas phebo gero</i>, 'I will teach you, Walter, why I carry
thorns in the moon,' seems to be an enigmatical mode of expressing the maxim that honesty
is the best policy."&nbsp;<a href="#note026"><u>[26]</u></a></p>

<p>About fifty years later, in the same century, Geoffrey Chaucer, in his <i>Troylus and
Creseide</i> adverts to the subject in these lines:</p>

<blockquote>
"(Quod Pandarus) Thou hast a full great care<br>
Lest the chorl may fall out of the moone."<br>
(Book i. Stanza 147.)
</blockquote>

<p>And in another place he says of Lady Cynthia, or the moon:</p>

<blockquote>
"Her gite was gray, and full of spottis blake,<br>
And on her brest a chorl painted ful even,<br>
Bering a bush of thornis on his backe,<br>
Whiche for his theft might clime so ner the heaven."
</blockquote>

<p>Whether Chaucer wrote the <i>Testament and Complaint of Creseide</i>, in which these
latter lines occur, is doubted, though it is frequently ascribed to him.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note027"><u>[27]</u></a></p>

<p>Dr. Reginald Peacock, Bishop of Chichester, in his <i>Repressor</i>, written about
1449, combats "this opinioun, that a man which stale sumtyme a birthan of thornis was
sett in to the moone, there for to abide for euere."</p>

<p>Thomas Dekker, a British dramatist, wrote in 1630: "A starre? Nay, thou art more than
the moone, for thou hast neither changing quarters, nor a man standing in thy circle with
a bush of thornes."&nbsp;<a href="#note028"><u>[28]</u></a></p>

<p>And last, but not least, amid the tuneful train, William Shakespeare, without whom no
review of English literature or of poetic lore could be complete, twice mentions the man
in the moon. First, in the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, Act iii. Scene 1, Quince the
carpenter gives directions for the performance of Pyramus and Thisby, who "meet by
moonlight," and says, "One must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and say he
comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine." Then in Act v. the player of
that part says, "All that I have to say is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I,
the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog." And,
secondly, in the <i>Tempest</i>, Act ii., Scene 2, Caliban and Stephano in dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
"<i>Cal</i>. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?<br>
<i>Ste</i>. Out o' the moon, I do assure thee. I was the man i' the moon, when time
was.<br>
<i>Cal</i>. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee: my mistress show'd me thee, thy
dog, and bush."
</blockquote>

<p>Robert Chambers refers the following singular lines to the man in the moon: adding,
"The allusion to Jerusalem pipes is curious; Jerusalem is often applied, in Scottish
popular fiction, to things of a nature above this world":</p>

<blockquote>
"I sat upon my houtie croutie (hams),<br>
I lookit owre my rumple routie (haunch),<br>
And saw John Heezlum Peezlum<br>
Playing on Jerusalem pipes."&nbsp;<a href="#note029"><u>[29]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an old-fashioned couplet belonging probably to our northern borders:</p>

<blockquote>
"The man in the moon<br>
Sups his sowins with a cutty spoon."
</blockquote>

<p>Halliwell explains <i>sowins</i> to be a Northumberland dish of coarse oatmeal and

<p>Wales is not without a memorial of this myth, for Mr. Baring-Gould tells us that
"there is an ancient pictorial representation of our friend the Sabbath-breaker in Gyffyn
Church, near Conway. The roof of the chancel is divided into compartments, in four of
which are the evangelistic symbols, rudely, yet effectively painted. Besides these
symbols is delineated in each compartment an orb of heaven. The sun, the moon, and two
stars, are placed at the feet of the Angel, the Bull, the Lion, and the Eagle. The
representation of the moon is as follows: in the disk is the conventional man with his
bundle of sticks, but without the dog."&nbsp;<a href="#note031"><u>[31]</u></a> Mr. Gould
says, "our friend the Sabbath-breaker" perhaps the artist would have said "the thief,"
for stealing appears to be more antique.</p>

<p>A French superstition, lingering to the present day, regards the man in the moon as
Judas Iscariot, transported to the moon for his treason. This plainly is a Christian
invention. Some say the figure is Isaac bearing a burthen of wood for the sacrifice of
himself on Mount Moriah. Others that it is Cain carrying a bundle of thorns on his
shoulder, and offering to the Lord the cheapest gift from the field.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note032"><u>[32]</u></a> This was Dante's view, as the succeeding passages will
show:</p>

<blockquote>
"For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine<br>
On either hemisphere, touching the wave<br>
Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight<br>
The moon was round."<br>
(<i>Hell</i>. Canto xx., line 123.)<br>
<br>
"But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots<br>
Upon this body, which below on earth<br>
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"<br>
(<i>Paradise</i>, ii. 50.)&nbsp;<a href="#note033"><u>[33]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>When we leave Europe, and look for the man in the moon under other skies, we find him,
but with an altogether new aspect. He is the same, and yet another; another, yet the
same. In China he plays a pleasing part in connubial affairs. "The Chinese 'Old Man in
the Moon' is known as <i>Yue-lao</i>, and is reputed to hold in his hands the power of
predestining the marriages of mortals--so that marriages, if not, according to the
native idea, exactly made in heaven, are made somewhere beyond the bounds of earth. He is
supposed to tie together the future husband and wife with an invisible silken cord, which
never parts so long as life exists."&nbsp;<a href="#note034"><u>[34]</u></a> This must be
the man of the Honey-moon, and we shall not meet his superior in any part of the world.
Among the Khasias of the Himalaya Mountains "the changes of the moon are accounted for by
the theory that this orb, who is a man, monthly falls in love with his wife's mother, who
throws ashes in his face. The sun is female."&nbsp;<a href="#note035"><u>[35]</u></a> The
Slavonic legend, following the Himalayan, says that "the moon, King of night and husband
of the sun, faithlessly loves the morning Star, wherefore he was cloven through in
punishment, as we see him in the sky."&nbsp;<a href="#note036"><u>[36]</u></a></p>

<p>"One man in his time plays many parts," and the man in the moon is no exception to the
rule. In Africa his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> is a trying one; for "in Bushman astrological
mythology the moon is looked upon as a man who incurs the wrath of the sun, and is
consequently pierced by the knife (<i>i.e.</i> rays) of the latter. This process is
repeated until almost the whole of the moon is cut away, and only a little piece left;
which the moon piteously implores the sun to spare for his (the moon's) children. (The
moon is in Bushman mythology a male being.) From this little piece, the moon gradually
grows again until it becomes a full moon, when the sun's stabbing and cutting processes
recommence."&nbsp;<a href="#note037"><u>[37]</u></a></p>

<p>We cross the Atlantic, and among the Greenlanders discover a myth, which is <i>sui
generis</i>. "The sun and moon are nothing else than two mortals, brother and sister.
They were playing with others at children's games in the dark, when <i>Malina</i>, being
teased in a shameful manner by her brother <i>Anninga</i>, smeared her hands with the
soot of the lamp, and rubbed them over the face and hands of her persecutor, that she
might recognise him by daylight. Hence arise the spots in the moon. Malina wished to save
herself by flight, but her brother followed at her heels. At length she flew upwards, and
became the sun. Anninga followed her, and became the moon; but being unable to mount so
high, he runs continually round the sun, in hopes of some time surprising her. When he is
tired and hungry in his last quarter, he leaves his house on a sledge harnessed to four
huge dogs, to hunt seals, and continues abroad for several days. He now fattens so
prodigiously on the spoils of the chase, that he soon grows into the full moon. He
rejoices on the death of women, and the sun has her revenge on the death of men; all
males therefore keep within doors during an eclipse of the sun, and females during that
of the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note038"><u>[38]</u></a> This Esquimaux story, which has
some interesting features, is told differently by Dr. Hayes, the Arctic explorer, who
puts a lighted taper into the sun's hands, with which she discovered her brother, and
which now causes her bright light, "while the moon, having lost his taper, is cold, and
could not be seen but for his sister's light."&nbsp;<a href="#note039"><u>[39]</u></a>
This belief prevails as far south as Panama, for the inhabitants of the Isthmus of Darien
have a tradition that the man in the moon was guilty of gross misconduct towards his
elder sister, the sun.&nbsp;<a href="#note040"><u>[40]</u></a></p>

<p>The Creek Indians say that the moon is inhabited by a man and a dog. The native tribes
of British Columbia, too, have their myth. Mr. William Duncan writes to the Church
Missionary Society: "One very dark night I was told that there was a moon to be seen on
the beach. On going to see, there was an illuminated disk, with the figure of a man upon
it. The water was then very low, and one of the conjuring parties had lit up this disk at
the water's edge. They had made it to wax with great exactness, and presently it was at
full. It was an imposing sight. Nothing could be seen around it; but the Indians suppose
that the medicine party are then holding converse with the man in the
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note041"><u>[41]</u></a> Mr. Duncan was at another time led to the
ancestral village of a tribe of Indians, whose chief said to him: "This is the place
where our fore fathers lived, and they told us something we want to tell you. The story
is as follows: 'One night a child of the chief class awoke and cried for water. Its cries
were very affecting--"Mother, give me to drink!" but the mother heeded not. The moon
was affected, and came down, entered the house, and approached the child, saying, "Here
is water from heaven: drink." The child anxiously laid hold of the pot and drank the
draught, and was enticed to go away with the moon, its benefactor. They took an
underground passage till they got quite clear of the village, and then ascended to
heaven.' And," said the chief, "our forefathers tell us that the figure we now see in the
moon is that very child; and also the little round basket which it had in its hand when
it went to sleep appears there."&nbsp;<a href="#note042"><u>[42]</u></a></p>

<p>The aborigines of New Zealand have a suggestive version of this superstition. It is
quoted from D'Urville by De Rougemont in his <i>Le Peuple Primitif</i> (tom. ii. p. 245),
and is as follows:--"Before the moon gave light, a New Zealander named Rona went out
in the night to fetch some water from the well. But he stumbled and unfortunately
sprained his ankle, and was unable to return home. All at once, as he cried out for very
anguish, he beheld with fear and horror that the moon, suddenly becoming visible,
descended towards him. He seized hold of a tree, and clung to it for safety; but it gave
way, and fell with Rona upon the moon; and he remains there to this day."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note043"><u>[43]</u></a> Another account of Rona varies in that he escapes falling into
the well by seizing a tree, and both he and the tree were caught up to the moon. The
variation indicates that the legend has a living root.</p>

<p>Here we terminate our somewhat wearisome wanderings about the world and through the
mazes of mythology in quest of the man in the moon. As we do so, we are constrained to
emphasize the striking similarity between the Scandinavian myth of Jack and Jill, that
exquisite tradition of the British Columbian chief, and the New Zealand story of Rona.
When three traditions, among peoples so far apart geographically, so essentially agree in
one, the lessons to be learned from comparative mythology ought not to be lost upon the
philosophical student of human history. To the believer in the unity of our race such a
comparison of legends is of the greatest importance. As Mr. Tylor tells us, "The number
of myths recorded as found in different countries, where it is hardly conceivable that
they should have grown independently, goes on steadily increasing from year to year, each
one furnishing a new clue by which common descent or intercourse is to be
traced."&nbsp;<a href="#note044"><u>[44]</u></a> The same writer says on another page of
his valuable work, "The mythmaking faculty belongs to mankind in general, and manifests
itself in the most distant regions, where its unity of principle develops itself in
endless variety of form."&nbsp;<a href="#note045"><u>[45]</u></a> Take, for example,
China and England, representing two distinct races, two languages, two forms of religion,
and two degrees of civilization yet, as W. F. Mayers remarks, "No one can compare the
Chinese legend with the popular European belief in the 'Man in the Moon,' without feeling
convinced of the certainty that the Chinese superstition and the English nursery tale are
both derived from kindred parentage, and are linked in this relationship by numerous
subsidiary ties. In all the range of Chinese mythology there is, perhaps, no stronger
instance of identity with the traditions that have taken root in Europe than in the case
of the legends relating to the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note046"><u>[46]</u></a> This being
the case, our present endeavour to establish the consanguinity of the nations, on the
ground of agreement in myths and modes of faith and worship, cannot be labour thrown
away. The recognition of friends in heaven is an interesting speculation; but far more
good must result, as concerns this life at least, from directing our attention to the
recognition of friends on earth. If we duly estimate the worth of any comparative
science, whether of anatomy or philology, mythology or religion, this is the grand
generalization to be attained, essential unity consistent and concurrent with endless
multiformity; many structures, but one life; many creeds, but one faith; many beings and
becomings, but all emanating from one Paternity, cohering through one Presence, and
converging to one Perfection, in Him who is the Author and Former and Finisher of all
things which exist. Let no man therefore ridicule a myth as puerile if it be an aid to
belief in that commonweal of humanity for which the Founder of the purest religion was a
witness and a martyr. We have sought out the man in the moon mainly because it was one
out of many scattered stories which, as Max M&uuml;ller nobly says, "though they may be
pronounced childish and tedious by some critics, seem to me to glitter with the brightest
dew of nature's own poetry, and to contain those very touches that make us feel akin, not
only with Homer or Shakespeare, but even with Lapps, and Finns, and
Kaffirs."&nbsp;<a href="#note047"><u>[47]</u></a> Vico discovered the value of myths, as
an addition to our knowledge of the mental and moral life of the men of the
myth-producing period. Professor Flint tells us that mythology, as viewed by the
contemporaries of Vico, "appeared to be merely a rubbish-heap, composed of waste,
worthless, and foul products of mind; but he perceived that it contained the materials
for a science which would reflect the mind and history of humanity, and even asserted
some general principles as to how these materials were to be interpreted and utilised,
which have since been established, or at least endorsed, by Heyne, Creuzer, C O
M&uuml;ller, and others."&nbsp;<a href="#note048"><u>[48]</u></a> Let us cease to call
that common which God has cleansed, and with thankfulness recognise the solidarity of the
human race, to which testimony is borne by even a lunar myth.</p>

<p>We now return to the point whence we deflected, and rejoin the chief actor in
the selenographic comedy. It is a relief to get away from the legendary man in
the moon, and to have the real man once more in sight. We are like the little
boy, whom the obliging visitor, anxious to show that he was passionately fond of
children, and never annoyed by them in the least, treated to a ride upon his
knee. &quot;Trot, trot, trot; how do you enjoy that, my little man? Isn't that nice?&quot;
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the child, &quot;but not so nice as on the real donkey, the one
with the four legs.&quot; It is true, the mythical character has redeeming traits;
but then he breaks the Sabbath, obstructs people going to mass, steals cabbages,
and is undergoing sentence of transportation for life. While the real man, who
lives in a well-lighted crescent, thoroughly ventilated; whose noble profile is
sometimes seen distinctly when he passes by on the shady side of the way; whose
beaming countenance is at other times turned full upon us, reflecting nothing
but sunshine as he winks at his many admirers: he is a being of quite another
order. We do not forget that he has been represented with a claret jug in one
hand, and a claret cup in the other; that he frequently takes half and half;
that he is a smoker; that he sometimes gets up when other people are going to
bed; that he often stops out all the night; and is too familiar with the low
song--</p>

<blockquote>
"We won't go home till morning."
</blockquote>

<p>But these are mere eccentricities of greatness, and with all such irregularities he is
"a very delectable, highly respectable" young fellow; in short,</p>

<blockquote>
"A most intense young man,<br>
A soul-full-eyed young man,<br>
An ultra-poetical, super-aesthetical,<br>
Out-of-the-way young man."
</blockquote>

<p>Why, he has been known to take the shine out of old Sol himself; though from his
partiality to us it always makes him look black in the face when we, Alexander-like,
stand between him and that luminary. We, too, are the only people by whom he ever allows
himself to be eclipsed. Illustrious man in the moon I he has lifted our thoughts from
earth to heaven, and we are reluctant to leave him. But the best of friends must part;
especially as other lunar inhabitants await attention.</p>

<p>"Other inhabitants!" some one may exclaim. Surely! we reply; and though it will
necessitate a digression, we touch upon the question <i>en passant</i>. Cicero informs us
that "Xenophanes says that the moon is inhabited, and a country having several towns and
mountains in it."&nbsp;<a href="#note049"><u>[49]</u></a> This single dictum will be
sufficient for those who bow to the influence of authority in matters of opinion.
Settlement of questions by "texts" is a saving of endless pains. For that there are such
lunar inhabitants must need little proof. Every astronomer is aware that the moon is full
of craters; and every linguist is aware that "cratur" is the Irish word for creature. Or,
to state the argument syllogistically, as our old friend Aristotle would have done:
"Craturs" are inhabitants; the moon is full of craters; therefore the moon is full of
inhabitants. We appeal to any unbiased mind whether such argumentation is not as sound as
much of our modern reasoning, conducted with every pretence to logic and lucidity.
Besides, who has not heard of that astounding publication, issued fifty years since, and
entitled <i>Great Astronomical Discoveries lately made by Sir John Herschel, LL.D.,
F.R.S., etc., at the Cape of Good Hope</i>? One writer dares to designate it a singular
satire; stigmatizes it as the once celebrated <i>Moon Hoax</i>, and attributes it to one
Richard Alton Locke, of the United States. What an insinuation! that a man born under the
star-spangled banner could trifle with astronomy. But if a few incredulous persons
doubted, a larger number of the credulous believed. When the first number appeared in the
New York Sun, in September, 1835, the excitement aroused was intense. The paper sold
daily by thousands; and when the articles came out as a pamphlet, twenty thousand went
off at once. Not only in Young America, but also in Old England, France, and throughout
Europe, the wildest enthusiasm prevailed. Could anybody reasonably doubt that Sir John
had seen wonders, when it was known that his telescope contained a prodigious lens,
weighing nearly seven tons, and possessing a magnifying power estimated at 42,000 times?
A reverend astronomer tells us that Sir Frederick Beaufort, having occasion to write to
Sir John Herschel at the Cape, asked if he had heard of the report current in England
that he (Sir John) had discovered sheep, oxen, and flying <i>men</i> in the moon. Sir
John had heard the report; and had further heard that an American divine had "improved"
the revelations. The said divine had told his congregation that, on account of the
wonderful discoveries of the present age, lie lived in expectation of one day calling
upon them for a subscription to buy Bibles for the benighted inhabitants of the
moon.&nbsp;<a href="#note050"><u>[50]</u></a> What more needs to be said? Give our
astronomical mechanicians a little time, and they will produce an instrument for full
verification of these statements regarding the lunar inhabitants; and we may realize more
than we have imagined or dreamed. We may obtain observations as satisfactory as those of
a son of the Emerald Isle, who was one day boasting to a friend of his excellent
telescope. "Do you see yonder church?" said he. "Although it is scarcely discernible with
the naked eye, when I look at it through my telescope, it brings it so close that I can
hear the organ playing." Two hundred years ago, a wise man witnessed a wonderful
phenomenon in the moon: he actually beheld a live elephant there. But the unbelieving
have ever since made all manner of fun at the good knight's expense. Take the following
burlesque of this celebrated discovery as an instance. "Sir Paul Neal, a conceited
virtuoso of the seventeenth century, gave out that he had discovered 'an elephant in the
moon.' It turned out that a mouse had crept into his telescope, which had been mistaken
for an elephant in the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note051"><u>[51]</u></a> Well, we concede
that an elephant and a mouse are very much alike; but surely Sir Paul was too sagacious
to be deceived by resemblances. If we had more faith, which is indispensable in such
matters, the revelations of science, however extraordinary or extravagant, would be
received without a murmur of distrust. We should not then meet with such sarcasm as we
found in the seventeenth century <i>Jest Book</i> before quoted: "One asked why men
should thinke there was a world in the moone? It was answered, because they were
lunatique."</p>

<p>According to promise, we must make mention of at least one visit paid by our hero to
this lower world. We do this in the classic language of a student of that grand old
University which stands in the city of Oxford. May the horns of Oxford be exalted, and
the shadow of the University never grow less, while the moon endureth!</p>

<blockquote>
"The man in the moon! why came he down<br>
From his peaceful realm on high;<br>
Where sorrowful moan is all unknown,<br>
And nothing is born to die?<br>
The man in the moon was tired, it seems,<br>
Of living so long in the land of dreams;<br>
'Twas a beautiful sphere, but nevertheless<br>
Its lunar life was passionless;<br>
Unchequered by sorrow, undimmed by crime,<br>
Untouched by the wizard wand of time;<br>
'Twas all too grand, there was no scope<br>
For dread, and of course no room for hope<br>
To him the future had no fear,<br>
To make the present doubly dear;<br>
The day no cast of coming night,<br>
To make the borrowed ray more bright;<br>
And life itself no thought of death,<br>
To sanctify the boon of breath:--<br>
In short, as we world-people say,<br>
The man in the moon was <i>ennuy&eacute;</i>."&nbsp;<a href="#note052"><u>[52]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Poor man in the moon! what a way he must have been in! We hope that he found improving
fellowship, say among the Fellows of some Royal Astronomical Society; and that when e
returned to his skylight, or lighthouse on the coast of immensity's wide sea, he returned
a wiser and much happier man. It is for us, too, to remember with Spenser, "The noblest
mind the best contentment has."</p>

<p>And now we record a few visits which men of this sublunary sphere are said to have
paid to the moon. The chronicles are unfortunately very incomplete. Aiming at historical
fulness and fidelity, we turned to our national bibliotheca at the British Museum, where
we fished out of the vasty deep of treasures a MS. without date or name. We wish the
Irish orator's advice were oftener followed by literary authors. Said he, "Never write an
anonymous letter without signing your name to it." This MS. is entitled
"<i>Selenographia</i>, or News from the world in the moon to the lunatics of this world.
By Lucas Lunanimus of Lunenberge."&nbsp;<a href="#note053"><u>[53]</u></a> We are here
told how the author, "making himself a kite of ye hight(?) of a large sheet, and tying
himself to the tayle of it, by the help of some trusty friends, to whom he promised
mountains of land in this his new-found world; being furnished also with a tube,
horoscope, and other instruments of discovery, he set saile the first of Aprill, a day
alwaies esteemed prosperous for such adventures." Fearing, however, lest the date of
departure should make some suspicious that the author was desirous of making his readers
April fools, we leave this a&euml;rial tourist to pursue his explorations without our
company, and listen to a learned bishop, who ought to be a canonical authority, for the
man in the moon himself is an overseer of men. Dr. Francis Godwin, first of Llandaff,
afterwards of Hereford, wrote about the year 1600 <i>The Man in the Moone</i>, or a
discourse of a voyage thither. This was published in 1638, under the pseudonym of Domingo
Gonsales. The enterprising aeronaut went up from the island of El Pico, carried by wild
swans. <i>Swans</i>, be it observed. It was not a wild-goose chase. The author is careful
to tell us what we believe so soon as it is declared. "The further we went, the lesser
the globe of the earth appeared to us; whereas still on the contrary side the moone
showed herselfe more and more monstrously huge." After eleven days' passage, the exact
time that Arago allowed for a cannon ball to reach the moon, "another earth" was
approached. "I perceived that it was covered for the most part with a huge and mighty
sea, those parts only being drie land, which show unto us here somewhat darker than the
rest of her body; that I mean which the country people call <i>el hombre della Luna</i>,
the man of the moone." This last clause demands a protest. The bishop knocks the
country-people's man out of the moon, to make room for his own man, which episcopal
creation is twenty-eight feet high, and weighs twenty-five or thirty of any of us.
Besides ordinary men, of extraordinary measurement, the bishop finds in the moon princes
and queens. The females, or lunar ladies, as a matter of course, are of absolute beauty.
Their language has "no affinity with any other I ever heard." This is a poor look-out for
the American divine who expects to send English Bibles to the moon. "Food groweth
everywhere without labour": this is a cheering prospect for our working classes who may
some day go there. "They need no lawyers": oh what a country! "And as little need is
there of physicians." Why, the moon must be Paradise regained. But, alas! "they die, or
rather (I should say) cease to live." Well, my lord bishop, is not that how we die on
earth? Perhaps we need to be learned bishops to appreciate the difference. If so, we
might accept episcopal distinction.</p>

<p>Lucian, the Greek satirist, in his <i>Voyage to the Globe of the Moon</i>, sailed
through the sky for the space of seven days and nights and on the eighth "arrived in a
great round and shining island which hung in the air and yet was inhabited. These
inhabitants were Hippogypians, and their king was Endymion."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note054"><u>[54]</u></a> Some of the ancients thought the lunarians were fifteen times
larger than we are, and our oaks but bushes compared with their trees. So natural is it
to magnify prophets not of our own country.</p>

<p>William Hone tells us that a Mr. Wilson, formerly curate of Halton Gill, near
Skipton-in-Craven, Yorkshire, in the last century wrote a tract entitled <i>The Man in
the Moon</i>, which was seriously meant to convey the knowledge of common astronomy in
the following strange vehicle: A cobbler, Israel Jobson by name, is supposed to ascend
first to the top of Penniguit; and thence, as a second stage equally practicable, to the
moon; after which he makes the grand tour of the whole solar system. From this excursion,
however, the traveller brings back little information which might not have been had upon
earth, excepting that the inhabitants of one of the planets, I forget which, were made of
"pot metal."&nbsp;<a href="#note055"><u>[55]</u></a> This curious tract, full of other
extravagances, is rarely if ever met with, it having been zealously bought up by its
writer's family.</p>

<p>We must not be detained with any detailed account of M. Jules Verne's captivating
books, entitled <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>, and <i>Around the Moon</i>. They are
accessible to all, at a trifling cost. Besides, they reveal nothing new relating to the
Hamlet of our present play. Nor need we more than mention "the surprising adventures of
the renowned Baron Munchausen." His lunarians being over thirty-six feet high, and "a
common flea being much larger than one of our sheep,"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note056"><u>[56]</u></a> Munchausen's moon must be declined, with thanks.</p>

<p>"Certain travellers, like the author of the <i>Voyage au monde de Descartes</i>, have
found, on visiting these different lunar countries, that the great men whose names they
had arbitrarily received took possession of them in the course of the sixteenth century,
and there fixed their residence. These immortal souls, it seems, continued their works
and systems inaugurated on earth. Thus it is, that on Mount Aristotle a real Greek city
has risen, peopled with peripatetic philosophers, and guarded by sentinels armed with
propositions, antitheses, and sophisms, the master himself living in the centre of the
town in a magnificent palace. Thus also in Plato's circle live souls continually occupied
in the study of the prototype of ideas. Two years ago a fresh division of lunar property
was made, some astronomers being generously enriched."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note057"><u>[57]</u></a></p>

<p>That the moon is an abode of the departed spirits of men, an upper hades, has been
believed for ages. In the Egyptian <i>Book of Respirations</i>, which M. p. J. de Horrack
has translated from the MS. in the Louvre in Paris, Isis breathes the wish for her
brother Osiris "that his soul may rise to heaven in the disk of the moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note058"><u>[58]</u></a> Plutarch says, "Of these soules the moon is the element,
because soules doe resolve into her, like as the bodies of the dead into the
earth."&nbsp;<a href="#note059"><u>[59]</u></a> To this ancient theory Mr. Tylor refers
when he writes, "And when in South America the Saliva Indians have pointed out the moon,
their paradise where no mosquitoes are, and the Guaycurus have shown it as the home of
chiefs and medicine-men deceased, and the Polynesians of Tokelau in like manner have
claimed it as the abode of departed kings and chiefs, then these pleasant fancies may be
compared with that ancient theory mentioned by Plutarch, that hell is in the air and
elysium in the moon, and again with the mediaeval conception of the moon as the seat of
hell, a thought elaborated in profoundest bathos by Mr. M. F. Tupper:</p>

<blockquote>
'I know thee well, O Moon, thou cavern'd realm,<br>
Sad satellite, thou giant ash of death,<br>
Blot on God's firmament, pale home of crime,<br>
Scarr'd prison house of sin, where damn&egrave;d souls<br>
Feed upon punishment. Oh, thought sublime,<br>
That amid night's black deeds, when evil prowls<br>
Through the broad world, thou, watching sinners well,<br>
Glarest o'er all, the wakeful eye of--Hell!'
</blockquote>

<p>Skin for skin, the brown savage is not ill-matched in such speculative lore with the
white philosopher."&nbsp;<a href="#note060"><u>[60]</u></a></p>

<p>The last journey to the moon on our list we introduce for the sake of its sacred
lesson. Pure religion is an Attic salt, which wise men use in all of their
entertainments: a condiment which seasons what is otherwise insipid, and assists healthy
digestion in the compound organism of man's mental and moral constitution. About seventy
years since, a little tract was published, in which the writer imagined himself on
<i>luna firma</i>. After giving the inhabitants of the moon an account of our terrestrial
race, of its fall and redemption, and of the unhappiness of those who neglect the great
salvation, he says, "The secret is this, that nothing but an infinite God, revealing
Himself by His Spirit to their minds, and enabling them to believe and trust in Him, can
give perfect and lasting satisfaction." He then adds, "My last observation received the
most marked approbation of the lunar inhabitants: they truly pitied the ignorant triflers
of our sinful world, who prefer drunkenness, debauchery, sinful amusements, exorbitant
riches, flattery, and other things that are highly esteemed amongst men, to the pleasures
of godliness, to the life of God in the soul of man, to the animating hope of future
bliss."&nbsp;<a href="#note061"><u>[61]</u></a></p>

<p>Here the man in the moon and we must part. Hitherto some may have supposed their
thoughts occupied with a mere creature of imagination, or gratuitous creation of an
old-world mythology. Perhaps the man in the moon is nothing more: perhaps he is very much
more. Possibly we have information of every being in the universe; and possibly there are
beings in every existing world of which we know nothing whatever. The latter possibility
we deem much the more probable. Remembering our littleness as contrasted with the
magnitude of the whole creation, we prefer to believe that there are rational creatures
in other worlds besides this small-sized sphere in, it may be, a small-sized system.
Therefore, till we acquire more conclusive evidence than has yet been adduced, we will
not regard even the moon as an empty abode, but as the home of beings whom, in the
absence of accurate definition, we denominate men. Whether the man in the moon have a
body like our own, whether his breathing apparatus, his digestive functions, and his
cerebral organs, be identical with ours, are matters of secondary moment. The Fabricator
of terrestrial organizations has limited himself to no one type or form, why then should
man be the model of beings in distant worlds? Be the man in the moon a biped or
quadruped; see he through two eyes as we do, or a hundred like Argus; hold he with two
hands as we do, or a hundred like Briarius; walk he with two feet as we do, or a hundred
like the centipede, "the mind's the standard of the man" everywhere. If he have but a
wise head and a warm heart; if he be not shut up, Diogenes--like, within his own
little tub of a world, but take an interest in the inhabitants of kindred spheres; and if
he be a worshipper of the one God who made the heavens with all their glittering
hosts;--then, in the highest sense, he is a <i>man</i>, to whom we would fain extend
the hand of fellowship, claiming him as a brother in that universal family which is
confined to no bone or blood, no colour or creed, and, so far as we can conjecture, to no
world, but is co-extensive with the household of the Infinite Father, who cares for all
of His children, and will ultimately blend them in the blessed bonds of an endless
confraternity. Whether we or our posterity will ever become better acquainted in this
life with the man in the moon is problematical; but in the ages to come, "when the
manifold wisdom of God" shall be developed among "the principalities and powers in
heavenly places," he may be something more than a myth or topic of amusement. He may be
visible among the first who will declare every man in his own tongue wherein he was born
the wonderful works of God, and he may be audible among the first who will lift their
hallelujahs of undivided praise when every satellite shall be a chorister to laud the
universal King. Let us, brothers of earth, by high and holy living, learn the music of
eternity; and then, when the discord of "life's little day" is hushed, and we are called
to join in the everlasting song, we may solve in one beatific moment the problem of the
plurality of worlds, and in that solution we shall see more than we have been able to see
at present of the man in the moon.</p><br>

<blockquote>
"O woman! lovely woman! nature made thee<br>
To temper man; we had been brutes without you.<br>
Angels are painted fair, to look like you:<br>
There's in you all that we believe of heaven<br>
Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,<br>
Eternal joy, and everlasting love."<br>
(Otway's <i>Venice Preserved</i>, 1682.)
</blockquote>

<p>It is not good that the man in the moon should be alone; therefore creative
imagination has supplied him with a companion. The woman in the moon as a myth does not
obtain to any extent in Europe; she is to be found chiefly in Polynesia, and among the
native races of North America. The <i>Middle Kingdom</i> furnishes the following
allusion: "The universal legend of the man in the moon takes in China a form that is at
least as interesting as the ruder legends of more barbarous people. The 'Goddess of the
Palace of the Moon,' Chang-o, appeals as much to our sympathies as, and rather more so
than, the ancient beldame who, in European folk-lore, picks up perpetual sticks to
satisfy the vengeful ideas of an ultra-Sabbatical sect. Mr. G. C. Stent has aptly seized
the idea of the Chinese versifier whom he translates</p>

<blockquote>
"On a gold throne, whose radiating brightness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dazzles the eyes--enhaloing the scene,<br>
Sits a fair form, arrayed in snowy whiteness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She is Chang-o, the beauteous Fairy Queen.<br>
Rainbow-winged angels softly hover o'er her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forming a canopy above the throne;<br>
A host of fairy beings stand before her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each robed in light, and girt with meteor zone.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note062"><u>[62]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>A touching tradition is handed down by Berthold that the moon is Mary Magdalene, and
the spots her tears of repentance.&nbsp;<a href="#note063"><u>[63]</u></a> Fontenelle,
the French poet and philosopher, saw a woman in the moon's changes. "Everything," he
says, "is in perpetual motion; even including a certain young lady in the moon, who was
seen with a telescope about forty years ago, everything has considerably aged. She had a
pretty good face, but her cheeks are now sunken, her nose is lengthened, her forehead and
chin are now prominent to such an extent, that all her charms have vanished, and I fear
for her days." "What are you relating to me now?" interrupted the marchioness. "This is
no jest," replied Fontenelle. "Astronomers perceived in the moon a particular figure
which had the aspect of a woman's head, which came forth from between the rocks, and then
occurred some changes in this region. Some pieces of mountain fell, and disclosed three
points which could only serve to compose a forehead, a nose, and an old woman's
chin."&nbsp;<a href="#note064"><u>[64]</u></a> Doubtless the face and the disfigurements
were fictions of the author's lively imagination, and his words savour less of science
than of satire; but Fontenelle was neither the first nor the last of those to whom "the
inconstant moon that monthly changes" has been an impersonation of the fickle and the
feminine. The following illustration is from Plutarch: "Cleobulus said, As touching
fooles, I will tell you a tale which I heard my mother once relate unto a brother of
mine. The time was (quoth she) that the moone praied her mother to make her a peticoate
fit and proportionate for her body. Why, how is it possible (quoth her mother) that I
should knit or weave one to fit well about thee considering that I see thee one while
full, another while croissant or in the wane and pointed with tips of horns, and sometime
again halfe rounde?"&nbsp;<a href="#note065"><u>[65]</u></a> Old John Lilly, one of our
sixteenth-century dramatists, likewise supports this ungallant theory. In the
<i>Prologus</i> to one of his very rare dramas he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
"Our poet slumb'ring in the muses laps,<br>
Hath seen a woman seated in the moone."&nbsp;<a href="#note066"><u>[66]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This woman is Pandora, the mischief-maker among the Utopian shepherds. In Act v. she
receives her commission to conform the moon to her own mutability:</p>

<blockquote>
"Now rule <i>Pandora</i> in fayre <i>Cynthia's</i> steede,<br>
And make the moone inconstant like thyselfe,<br>
Raigne thou at women's nuptials, and their birth,<br>
Let them be mutable in all their loves.<br>
Fantasticall, childish, and folish, in their desires<br>
Demanding toyes; and stark madde<br>
When they cannot have their will."
</blockquote>

<p>In North America the woman in the moon is a cosmological myth. Take, for example, the
tale told by the Esquimaux, which word is the French form of the Algonquin Indian
<i>Eskimantsic</i>, "raw-flesh eaters." "Their tradition of the formation of the sun and
moon is, that not long after the world was formed, a great conjuror or angikak became so
powerful that he could ascend into the heavens when he pleased, and on one occasion took
with him a beautiful sister whom he loved very much, and also some fire, to which he
added great quantities of fuel, and thus formed the sun. For a time the conjuror treated
his sister with great kindness, and they lived happily together; but at last he became
cruel, ill-used her in many ways, and, as a climax, burnt one side of her face with fire.
After this last indignity she ran away from him and became the moon. Her brother in the
sun has been in chase of her ever since; but although he sometimes gets near, will never
overtake her. When new moon, the burnt side of her face is towards the earth; when full
moon, the reverse is the case."&nbsp;<a href="#note067"><u>[67]</u></a> The likeness
between this tradition and the Greenlanders' myth of Malina and Anninga is very close,
the difference consisting chiefly in the change of sex; here the moon is feminine, there
the moon is masculine.&nbsp;<a href="#note068"><u>[68]</u></a></p>

<p>In Brazil the story is further varied, in that it is the sister who falls in love, and
receives a discoloured face for her offence. Professor Hartt says that Dr. Silva de
Coutinho found on the Rio Branco and Sr. Barbosa has reported from the Jamund&aacute; a
myth "in which the moon is represented as a maiden who fell in love with her brother and
visited him at night, but who was finally betrayed by his passing his blackened hand over
her face."&nbsp;<a href="#note069"><u>[69]</u></a></p>

<p>The Ottawa tale of Indian cosmogony, called Iosco, narrates the adventures of two
Indians who "found themselves in a beautiful country, lighted by the moon, which shed
around a mild and pleasant light. They could see the moon approaching as if it were from
behind a hill. They advanced, and the aged woman spoke to them; she had a white face and
pleasing air, and looked rather old, though she spoke to them very kindly. They knew from
her first appearance that she was the moon. She asked them several questions. She
informed them that they were halfway to her brother's (the sun), and that from the earth
to her abode was half the distance."&nbsp;<a href="#note070"><u>[70]</u></a></p>

<p>Other American Indians have a tradition of an old woman who lived with her
grand-daughter, the most beautiful girl that ever was seen in the country. Coming of age,
she wondered that only herself and her grandmother were in the world. The grandam
explained that an evil spirit had destroyed all others; but that she by her power had
preserved herself and her grand-daughter. This did not satisfy the young girl, who
thought that surely some survivors might be found. She accordingly travelled in search,
till on the tenth day she found a lodge inhabited by eleven brothers, who were hunters.
The eleventh took her to wife, and died after a son was born. The widow then wedded each
of the others, beginning with the youngest. When she took the eldest, she soon grew tired
of him, and fled away by the western portal of the hunter's lodge. Tearing up one of the
stakes which supported the door, she disappeared in the earth with her little dog. Soon
all trace of the fugitive was lost. Then she emerged from the earth in the east, where
she met an old man fishing in the sea. This person was he who made the earth. He bade her
pass into the air toward the west. Meanwhile the deserted husband pursued his wife into
the earth on the west, and out again on the east, where the tantalizing old fisherman
cried out to him, "Go, go; you will run after your wife as long as the earth lasts
without ever overtaking her, and the nations who will one day be upon the earth will call
you <i>Gizhigooke</i>, he who makes the day." From this is derived <i>Gizis</i>, the sun.
Some of the Indians count only eleven moons, which represent the eleven brothers, dying
one after another.&nbsp;<a href="#note071"><u>[71]</u></a></p>

<p>Passing on to Polynesia, we reach Samoa, where "we are told that the moon came down
one evening, and picked up a woman, called Sina, and her child. It was during a time of
famine. She was working in the evening twilight, beating out some bark with which to make
native cloth. The moon was just rising, and it reminded her of a great bread-fruit.
Looking up to it, she said, 'Why cannot you come down and let my child have a bit of
you?' The moon was indignant at the idea of being eaten, came down forthwith, and took
her up, child, board, mallet, and all. The popular superstition is not yet forgotten in
Samoa of the <i>woman</i> in the moon. 'Yonder is Sina,' they say, 'and her child, and
her mallet, and board.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note072"><u>[72]</u></a> The same belief is held
in the adjacent Tonga group, or Friendly Islands, as they were named by Captain Cook, on
account of the supposed friendliness of the natives. "As to the spots in the moon, they
are compared to the figure of a woman sitting down and beating <i>gnatoo</i>" (bark used
for clothing).&nbsp;<a href="#note073"><u>[73]</u></a></p>

<p>In Mangaia, the southernmost island of the Hervey cluster, the woman in the moon is
Ina, the pattern wife, who is always busy, and indefatigable in the preparation of
resplendent cloth, <i>i.e.</i> <i>white clouds</i>. At Atiu it is said that Ina took to
her celestial abode a mortal husband, whom, after many happy years, she sent back to the
earth on a beautiful rainbow, lest her fair home should be defiled by
death.&nbsp;<a href="#note074"><u>[74]</u></a> Professor Max M&uuml;ller is reminded by
this story of Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Endymion, of Eos and Tithonos.</p><br>
<a name="I4" id="I4"></a>IV. THE HARE IN THE MOON.<br>

<p>When the moon is waxing, from about the eighth day to the full, it requires no very
vivid imagination to descry on the westward side of the lunar disk a large patch very
strikingly resembling a rabbit or hare. The oriental noticing this figure, his poetical
fancy developed the myth-making faculty, which in process of time elaborated the legend
of the hare in the moon, which has left its marks in every quarter of the globe. In Asia
it is indigenous, and is an article of religious belief. "To the common people in India
the spots look like a hare, <i>i.e.</i> Chandras, the god of the moon, carries a hare
(sasa), hence the moon is called Sasin or Sasanka, hare mark or spot."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note075"><u>[75]</u></a> Max M&uuml;ller also writes, "As a curious coincidence it may
be mentioned that in Sanskrit the moon is called Sas<font face=
"Times New Roman">&#257;nka,</font><i>i.e.</i> 'having the marks of a hare,' the black
marks in the moon being taken for the likeness of the hare."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note076"><u>[76]</u></a> This allusion to the sacred language of the Hindus affords a
convenient opportunity of introducing one of the most beautiful legends of the East. It
is a Buddhist tract; but in the lesson which it embodies it will compare very favourably
with many a tract more ostensibly Christian.</p>

<p>"In former days, a hare, a monkey, a coot, and a fox, became hermits, and lived in a
wilderness together, after having sworn not to kill any living thing. The god Sakkria
having seen this through his divine power, thought to try their faith, and accordingly
took upon him the form of a brahmin, and appearing before the monkey begged of him alms,
who immediately brought to him a bunch of mangoes, and presented it to him. The pretended
brahmin, having left the monkey, went to the coot and made the same request, who
presented him a row of fish which he had just found on the bank of a river, evidently
forgotten by a fisherman. The brahmin then went to the fox, who immediately went in
search of food, and soon returned with a pot of milk and a dried liguan, which he had
found in a plain, where apparently they had been left by a herdsman. The brahmin at last
went to the hare and begged alms of him. The hare said, 'Friend, I eat nothing but grass,
which I think is of no use to you.' Then the pretended brahmin replied, 'Why, friend, if
you are a true hermit, you can give me your own flesh in hope of future happiness.' The
hare directly consented to it, and said to the supposed brahmin, 'I have granted your
request, and you may do whatever you please with me.' The brahmin then replied, 'Since
you are willing to grant my request, I will kindle a fire at the foot of the rock, from
which you may jump into the fire, which will save me the trouble of killing you and
dressing your flesh.' The hare readily agreed to it, and jumped from the top of the rock
into the fire which the supposed brahmin had kindled; but before he reached the fire, it
was extinguished; and the brahmin appearing in his natural shape of the god Sakkria, took
the hare in his arms and immediately drew its figure in the moon, in order that every
living thing of every part of the world might see it."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note077"><u>[77]</u></a> All will acknowledge that this is a very beautiful allegory.
How many in England, as well as in Ceylon, are described by the monkey, the coot, and the
fox--willing to bring their God any oblation which costs them nothing; but how few
are like the hare--ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice, to be consumed
as a burnt offering in the Divine service! Those, however, who lose their lives in such
self-sacrifice, shall find them, and be caught up to "shine as the brightness of the
firmament and as the stars for ever and ever."</p>

<p>Another version of this legend is slightly variant. Grimm says: "The people of Ceylon
relate as follows: While Buddha the great god sojourned upon earth as a hermit, he one
day lost his way in a wood. He had wandered long, when a <i>hare</i> accosted him:
'Cannot I help thee? Strike into the path on thy right. I will guide thee out of the
wilderness.' Buddha replied: 'Thank thee, but I am poor and hungry, and unable to repay
thy kindness.' 'If thou art hungry,' said the hare, 'light a fire, and kill, roast, and
eat me.' Buddha made a fire, and the hare immediately jumped in. Then did Buddha manifest
his divine power; he snatched the beast out of the flames, and set him in the moon, where
he may be seen to this day."&nbsp;<a href="#note078"><u>[78]</u></a> Francis Douce, the
antiquary, relates this myth, and adds, "this is from the information of a learned and
intelligent French gentleman recently arrived from Ceylon, who adds that the Cingalese
would often request of him to permit them to look for the hare through his telescope, and
exclaim in raptures that they saw it. It is remarkable that the Chinese represent the
moon by a rabbit pounding rice in a mortar. Their mythological moon Jut-ho is figured by
a beautiful young woman with a double sphere behind her head, and a rabbit at her feet.
The period of this animal's gestation is thirty days; may it not therefore typify the
moon's revolution round the earth."&nbsp;<a href="#note079"><u>[79]</u></a></p>

<p>S&Acirc;KYAMUNI AS A HARE IN THE MOON.</p>
</center>

<center>
<i>Collin de Plancy's</i> "<i>Dictionnaire Infernal</i>."
</center><br>

<p>In this same apologue we have doubtless a duplicate, the original or a copy, of
another Buddhist legend found among the Kalmucks of Tartary; in which S&acirc;kyamuni
himself, in an early stage of existence, had inhabited the body of a hare. Giving himself
as food to feed the hunger of a starving creature, he was immediately placed in the moon,
where he is still to be seen.&nbsp;<a href="#note080"><u>[80]</u></a></p>

<p>The Mongolian also sees a hare in the lunar shadows. We are told by a Chinese scholar
that "tradition earlier than the period of the Han dynasty asserted that a hare inhabited
the surface of the moon, and later Taoist fable depicted this animal, called the gemmeous
hare, as the servitor of the genii, who employ it in pounding the drugs which compose the
elixir of life. The connection established in Chinese legend between the hare and the
moon is probably traceable to an Indian original. In Sanskrit inscriptions the moon is
called Sason, from a fancied resemblance of its spots to a leveret; and pandits, to whom
maps of the moon's service have been shown, have fixed on <i>Loca Paludosa</i>, and
<i>Mons Porphyrites</i> or <i>Keplerus</i> and <i>Aristarchus</i>, for the spots which
they think exhibit the similitude of a hare."&nbsp;<a href="#note081"><u>[81]</u></a> On
another page of the same work we read: "During the T'ang dynasty it was recounted that a
cassia tree grows in the moon, this notion being derived apparently from an Indian
source. The <i>sal</i> tree (<i>shorea robusta</i>), one of the sacred trees of the
Buddhists, was said during the Sung dynasty to be identical with the cassia tree in the
moon. The lunar hare is said to squat at the foot of the cassia tree, pounding its drugs
for the genii. The cassia tree in the moon is said to be especially visible at
mid-autumn, and hence to take a degree at the examinations which are held at this period
is described as plucking a leaf from the cassia."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note082"><u>[82]</u></a></p>

<p>This hare myth, attended with the usual transformation, has travelled to the
Hottentots of South Africa. The fable which follows is entitled "From an original
manuscript in English, by Mr. John Priestly, in Sir G. Grey's library." "The moon, on one
occasion, sent the hare to the earth to inform men that as she (the moon) died away and
rose again, so mankind should die and rise again. Instead, however, of delivering this
message as given, the hare, either out of forgetfulness or malice, told mankind that as
the moon rose and died away, so man should die and rise no more. The hare, having
returned to the moon, was questioned as to the message delivered, and the moon, having
heard the true state of the case, became so enraged with him that she took up a hatchet
to split his head; falling short, however, of that, the hatchet fell upon the upper lip
of the hare, and cut it severely. Hence it is that we see the 'hare-lip.' The hare, being
duly incensed at having received such treatment, raised his claws, and scratched the
moon's face; and the dark parts which we now see on the surface of the moon are the scars
which she received on that occasion."&nbsp;<a href="#note083"><u>[83]</u></a> In an
account of the Hottentot myth of the "Origin of Death," the angered moon heats a stone
and burns the hare's mouth, causing the hare-lip.&nbsp;<a href="#note084"><u>[84]</u></a>
Dr. Marshall may tell us, with all the authority of an eminent physiologist, that
hare-lip is occasioned by an arrest in the development of certain frontal and nasal
processes,&nbsp;<a href="#note085"><u>[85]</u></a> and we may receive his explanation as
a sweetly simple solution of the question; but who that suffers from this leporine-labial
deformity would not prefer a supernatural to a natural cause? Better far that the lip
should be cleft by Shakespeare's "foul fiend Flibbertigibbet," than that an abnormal
condition should be accounted for by science, or comprised within the reign of physical
law.</p>

<p>Even Europe is somewhat hare-brained: for Caesar tells us that the Britons did not
regard it lawful to eat the hare, though he does not say why; and in Swabia still,
children are forbidden to make shadows on the wall to represent the sacred hare of the
moon.</p>

<p>We may pursue this matter even in Mexico, whose deities and myths a recent Hibbert
lecturer brought into clearer light, showing that the Mexicans "possessed beliefs,
institutions, and a developed mythology which would bear comparison with anything known
to antiquity in the old world."&nbsp;<a href="#note086"><u>[86]</u></a> The Tezcucans, as
they are usually called, are described by Prescott as "a nation of the same great family
with the Aztecs, whom they rivalled in power, and surpassed in intellectual culture and
the arts of social refinement."&nbsp;<a href="#note087"><u>[87]</u></a> Their account of
the creation is that "the sun and moon came out equally bright, but this not seeming good
to the gods, one of them took a rabbit by the heels and slung it into the face of the
moon, dimming its lustre with a blotch, whose mark may be seen to this
day."&nbsp;<a href="#note088"><u>[88]</u></a></p>

<p>We have now seen that the fancy of a hare in the moon is universal; but not so much
importance is to be attached to this, as to some other aspects of moon mythology. The
hare-like patch is visible in every land, and suggested the animal to all observers. That
the rabbit's period of gestation is thirty days is a singular coincidence; but that is
all--nay, it is not even that, for "the moon's revolution round the earth," which
Douce supposed the Chinese myth to typify, is accomplished in a little more than
<i>twenty-seven</i> days. Neither is much weight due to the fanciful comparison of
Gubernatis: "The moon is the watcher of the sky, that is to say, she sleeps with her eyes
open; so also does the hare, whence the <i>somnus leporinus</i> became a
proverb."&nbsp;<a href="#note089"><u>[89]</u></a> The same author says on another page,
and here we follow him: "The mythical hare is undoubtedly the moon. In the first story of
the third book of the <i>Pancatantram</i>, the hares dwell upon the shore of the lake
Candrasaras, or lake of the moon, and their king has for his palace the lunar
disk."&nbsp;<a href="#note090"><u>[90]</u></a> It is this story, which Mr. Baring-Gould
relates in outline; and which we are compelled still further to condense. In a certain
forest there once lived a herd of elephants. Long drought having dried up the lakes and
swamps, an exploring party was sent out in search of a fresh supply of water. An
extensive lake was discovered, called the moon lake. The elephants with their king
eagerly marched to the spot, and found their thirsty hopes fully realized. All round the
lake were in numerable hare warrens, which the tread of the mighty monsters crushed
unmercifully, maiming and mangling the helpless inhabitants. When the elephants had
withdrawn, the poor hares met together in terrible plight, to consult upon the course
which they should take when their enemies returned. One wise hare undertook the task of
driving the ponderous herd away. This he did by going alone to the elephant king, and
representing himself as the hare which lived in the moon. He stated that he was deputed
by his excellency the moon to say that if the elephants came any more to the lake, the
beams of night would be withheld, and their bodies would be burned up with perpetual
sunshine. The king of the elephants thinking that "the better part of valour is
discretion," decided to offer an apology for his offence. He was conducted to the lake,
where the moon was reflected in the water, apparently meditating his revenge. The
elephant thrust his proboscis into the lake, which disturbed the reflection. Whereupon
the elephant, judging the moon to be enraged, hurried with his apology, and then went off
vowing never to return. The wise hare had proven that "wisdom is better than strength";
and the hares suffered no more molestation. "We may also remark, in this event, the truth
of that saying of Euripides, 'that one wise counsel is better than the strength of many'"
(<i>Polybius</i>, i. 35).</p><br>
<a name="I5" id="I5"></a>V. THE TOAD IN THE MOON.

<p>We owe an immense debt of gratitude and honour to the many enterprising and cultivated
men who have gone into all parts of the earth and among all peoples to investigate human
history and habit, mythology and religion, and thus enrich the stores of our national
literature. With such a host of travellers gathering up the fragments, nothing of value
is likely to be lost. We have to thank intelligent explorers for all we know of the
mythical frog or toad in the moon: an addition to our information which is not unworthy
of thoughtful notice.</p>

<p>The Selish race of North-west American Indians, who inhabit the country between the
Cascade and Rocky Mountains, have a tradition, which Captain Wilson relates as follows:
"The expression of 'a toad in the moon,' equivalent to our 'man in the moon,' is
explained by a very pretty story relating how the little wolf, being desperately in love
with the toad, went a-wooing one night and prayed that the moon might shine brightly on
his adventure; his prayer was granted, and by the clear light of a full moon he was
pursuing the toad, and had nearly caught her, when, as a last chance of escape, she made
a desperate spring on to the face of the moon, where she remains to this
day."&nbsp;<a href="#note091"><u>[91]</u></a> Another writer says that "the Cowichan
tribes think that the moon has a frog in it."&nbsp;<a href="#note092"><u>[92]</u></a></p>

<p>From the Great Western we turn to the Great Eastern world, and in China find
the frog in the moon. &quot;The famous astronomer Chang Hêng was avowedly a disciple
of Indian teachers. The statement given by Chang Hêng is to the effect that 'How
I, the fabled inventor of arrows in the days of Yao and Shun,[*] obtained the
drug of immortality from Si Wang Mu (the fairy 'Royal Mother' of the West); and
Chang Ngo (his wife) having stolen it, fled to the moon, and became the frog--<i>Chang-chu</i>--which is
seen there.' The lady <i>Chang-ngo</i> is still pointed out among the shadows in the
surface of the Moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note093"><u>[93]</u></a> Dr. Wells Williams also
tells us that in China "the sun is symbolized by the figure of a raven in a circle, and
the moon by a rabbit on his hind legs pounding rice in a mortar, or by a three-legged
toad. The last refers to the legend of an ancient beauty, Chang-ngo, who drank the liquor
of immortality, and straightway ascended to the moon, where she was transformed into a
toad, still to be traced in its face. It is a special object of worship in autumn, and
moon cakes dedicated to it are sold at this season."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note094"><u>[94]</u></a> We have little doubt that what the Chinese look for they see.
We in the West characterize and colour objects which we behold, as we see them through
the painted windows of our predisposition or prejudice. As a great novelist writes: "From
the same object different conclusions are drawn; the most common externals of nature, the
wind and the wave, the stars and the heavens, the very earth on which we tread, never
excite in different bosoms the same ideas; and it is from our own hearts, and not from an
outward source, that we draw the hues which colour the web of our existence. It is true,
answered Clarence. You remember that in two specks of the moon the enamoured maiden
perceived two unfortunate lovers, while the ambitious curate conjectured that they were
the spires of a cathedral."&nbsp;<a href="#note095"><u>[95]</u></a> Besides, it must be
confessed that the particular moon-patch that has awakened so much interest in every age
and nation is quite as much like a frog or toad as it is like a rabbit or hare.</p>

<a name="I6" id="I6"></a>VI. OTHER MOON MYTHS.

<p>It is almost time that we should leave this lunar zoology; we will therefore merely
present a few creatures which may be of service in a comparative anatomy of the whole
subject, and then close the account. There is a story told in the Fiji Islands which so
nearly approaches the Hottentot legend of the hare, that they both seem but variations of
a common original. In the one case the opponent of the moon's benevolent purpose
affecting man's hereafter was a hare, in the other a rat. The story thus runs: There was
"a contest between two gods as to how man should die. Ra Vula (the moon) contended that
man should be like himself--disappear awhile, and then live again. Ra Kalavo (the
rat) would not listen to this kind proposal, but said, 'Let man die as a rat dies.' And
he prevailed."&nbsp;<a href="#note096"><u>[96]</u></a> Mr. Tylor, who quotes this rat
story, adds: "The dates of the versions seem to show that the presence of these myths
among the Hottentots and Fijians, at the two opposite sides of the globe, is at any rate
not due to transmission in modern times."&nbsp;<a href="#note097"><u>[97]</u></a></p>

<p>From the rat to one of its mortal enemies is an easy transition. The Australian story
is that Mityan, the moon, was a native cat, who fell in love with another's wife, and
while trying to induce her to run away with him, was discovered by the husband, when a
fight took place. Mityan was beaten and ran away, and has been wandering ever
since.&nbsp;<a href="#note098"><u>[98]</u></a> We are indebted for another suggestion to
Bishop Wilkins, who wrote over two centuries ago: "As for the form of those spots,
<i>Albertus</i> thinks that it represents a lion, with his tail towards the east, and his
head the west; and some others have thought it to be very much like a fox, and certainly
'tis as much like a lion as that in the <i>zodiac</i>, or as <i>ursa major</i> is like a
bear."&nbsp;<a href="#note099"><u>[99]</u></a> This last remark of the old mathematician
is "a hit, a very palpable hit," at those unpoetical people who catalogue the
constellations under all sorts of living creatures' names, implying resemblances, and
then "sap with solemn sneer" our myths of the moon.</p>

<p>We have now seen that the moon is populated with men, women, and children,--hares
and rabbits, toads and frogs, cats and dogs, and sundry small "cattle"; we observe in
making our exit that it is also planted with a variety of trees; in short, is a
zoological garden of a high order. Even among the ancients some said the lunar spots were
forests where Diana hunted, and that the bright patches were plains. Captain Cook tells
us that in the South Pacific "the spots observed in the moon are supposed to be groves of
a sort of trees which once grew in Otaheite, and, being destroyed by some accident, their
seeds were carried up thither by doves, where they now flourish."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note100"><u>[100]</u></a> Ellis also tells of these Tahitians that "their ideas of the
moon, which they called <i>avae</i> or <i>marama</i>, were as fabulous as those they
entertained of the sun. Some supposed the moon was the wife of the sun; others that it
was a beautiful country in which the aoa grew."&nbsp;<a href="#note101"><u>[101]</u></a>
These arborary fancies derive additional interest, if not a species of verisimilitude,
from the record of a missionary that "a stately tree, clothed with dark shining leaves,
and loaded with many hundreds of large green or yellowish-coloured fruit, is one of the
most splendid and beautiful objects to be met with among the rich and diversified scenery
of a Tahitian landscape."</p>

<p>Our collection of lunar legends is now on exhibition. No thoughtful person will be
likely to dispute the dictum of Sir John Lubbock that "traditions and myths are of great
importance, and indirectly throw much light on the condition of man in ancient
times."&nbsp;<a href="#note102"><u>[102]</u></a> But they serve far more purposes than
this. They are the raw material, out of which many of our goodly garments of modern
science and religion are made up. The illiterate negroes on the cotton plantation, and
the rude hunters in the jungle or seal fishery, produce the staple, or procure the skins,
which after long labour afford comfort and adornment to proud philosophers and peers. The
golden cross on the saintly bosom and the glittering crown on the sovereign brow were
embedded as rough ore in primeval rocks ages before their wearers were born to boast of
them. We shall esteem our treasures none the less because their origin is known, as we
love "the Best of men" none the less because he was born of a woman. We closed our series
of moon myths with a vision of a beautiful country, ornamented with groves of fruitful
trees, whose seeds had been carried thither by white-winged doves; and carried thither
because "some accident" had destroyed the trees in their native isles on earth. Thus the
lunar world had become a desirable scene of superior and surpassing loveliness. Who can
reflect upon this dream of human childhood, and not recall some dreams of later years?
Who can fail to discern slight touches of the same hand which we see displayed in other
designs? "Happily for historic truth," says Mr. Tylor, "mythic tradition tells its tales
without expurgating the episodes which betray its real character to more critical
observation."&nbsp;<a href="#note103"><u>[103]</u></a> Who is not led on from Tahiti to
Greece, and to the Isles of the Blessed, the Elysium which abounds in every charm of
life, and to the garden of the Hesperides, with its apples of gold; thence to the Meru of
the Hindoos, the sacred mountain which is perpetually clothed in the rays of the sun, and
adorned with every variety of plants and trees; thence again to the Heden of the
Persians, of matchless beauty, where ever flourishes the tree Hom with its wonderful
fruit; on to the Chinese garden, near the gate of heaven, whose noblest spring is the
fountain of life, and whose delightful trees bear fruits which preserve and prolong the
existence of man?&nbsp;<a href="#note104"><u>[104]</u></a> Thence an easy entrance is
gained to the Hebrew Paradise, with its abounding trees "pleasant to the sight and good
for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden"; and finally arises a sight
of the "better land" of the Christian poetess, the incorruptible and undefiled
inheritance of the Christian preacher, the prospect which is "ever vernal and
blooming,--and, best of all, amid those trees of life there lurks no serpent to
destroy,--the country, through whose vast region we shall traverse with untired
footsteps, while every fresh revelation of beauty will augment our knowledge, and
holiness, and joy."&nbsp;<a href="#note105"><u>[105]</u></a> Who will travel on such a
pilgrimage of enlarged thought, and not come to the conclusion that if one course of
development has been followed by all scientific and spiritual truth, then "almost the
whole of the mythology and theology of civilized nations maybe traced, without
arrangement or co-ordination, and in forms that are undeveloped and original rather than
degenerate, in the traditions and ideas of savages"?&nbsp;<a href=
"#note106"><u>[106]</u></a> Such a conclusion may diminish our self-esteem, if we have
supposed ourselves the sole depositaries of Divine knowledge; but it will exalt our
conception of the generosity of the Father of all men, who never left a human soul
without a witness of His invisible presence and ineffable love.<br>

<a name="II" id="II"></a>MOON WORSHIP.
</center><br>
<a name="II1" id="II1"></a>I. INTRODUCTION.

<p>We have now to show that the moon has been in every age, and remains still, one of the
principal objects of human worship. Even among certain nations credited with pure
monotheism, it will be manifested that there was the practice of that primitive
polytheism which adored the hosts of heaven. And, however humiliating or disappointing
the disclosure may prove, it will be established that some of the foremost Christian
peoples of the world maintain luniolatry to this day, notwithstanding that they have the
reproving light of the latest civilization. We are so prone to talk of heathenism as
abroad, that we forget or neglect the gross heathenism which abounds at home; and while
we complacently speak of the march of the world's progress with which we identify
ourselves, we are oblivious of the fact that much ancient falsehood survives and blends
with the truth in which our superior minds, or minds with superior facilities, have been
trained. How few of us reflect that the signs and symbols of rejected theories have
passed into the nomenclature of received systems! Nay, we plume ourselves upon the new
translation or revision as if we were the favoured recipients of some fresh revelation.
Not only in the names of our days and months, but also in some of our most cherished
dogmas, we are but the "liberal-conservatives" in religion, who retain the old, while we
congratulate ourselves upon being the apostles of the new. That the past must always run
into the present, and the present proceed from the past, we readily enough allow as a
natural and necessary law; yet baptized heathenism is often heathenism still, under
another name. Again, we are sometimes so short-sighted that we deny to former periods the
paternity of their own more fortunate offspring, and behave like prosperous children who
ungratefully ignore their poorer parents, to whom they owe their breath and being. Such
treatment of history is to be emphatically deprecated, whether it arises from ignorance
or ingratitude. We ought to know, if we do not, and we ought also to acknowledge, that
our perfect day grew out of primeval darkness, and that the progress was a lingering
dawn. This we hold to be the clearest view of the Divine causation. Our modern method in
philosophy, largely owing to the <i>Novum Organum</i> of Bacon, is evolution, the
<i>novum organum</i> of the nineteenth century; and this process recognises no abrupt or
interruptive creations, but gradual transformations from pre-existent types, "variations
under domestication," and the passing away of the old by its absorption into the new. Our
religion, like our language, is a garden not only for indigenous vegetation, but also for
acclimatisation, in which we improve under cultivation exotic plants whose roots are
drawn from every soil on the earth. And, as Paul preached in Athens the God whom the
Greeks worshipped in ignorance, so our missionaries carry back to less enlightened
peoples the fruit of that life-giving tree whose germs exist among themselves,
undeveloped and often unknown. No religion has fallen from heaven, like the fabled image
of Athene, in full-grown beauty. All spiritual life is primordially an inspiration or
intuition from the Father of spirits, whose offspring all men are, and who is not far
from every one of them. This intuition prompts men to "seek the Lord, if haply they might
feel after Him, and find Him." Thus prayer becomes an instinct; and to worship is as
natural as to breathe. But man is a being with five senses, and as his contact with his
fellow-creatures and with the whole creation is at one or other of those five points, he
is necessarily sensuous. Endowed with native intelligence, the <i>intellectus ipse</i> of
Leibnitz, he nevertheless receives his impressions on <i>sensitive</i> nerves, his
emotions are <i>sentiments</i>, his words become <i>sentences</i>, and his stock of
wisdom is his common <i>sense</i>. A few, very few, words express his sensations, a few
more his perceptions, and so on; but he is conscious of <i>objects</i> at first, he deals
with <i>subjects</i> afterwards. Soon the sun, moon, and stars, as bright lights attract
his eyes, as we have all seen an infant of a few days fix its gaze upon a candle or lamp.
These heavenly orbs are found to be in motion, to be far away, to be the glory of day and
night: what wonder if <i>ideas</i> of these <i>images</i> are formed in the religious
mind, if the worshipper imagines the sun and moon to be reflections of the God of light,
and pays homage to the creature which renders the Creator visible? Thus in the childhood
of man religion grows, and with the multiplication of intellect and sensation, endless
diversity of language, conception and faith is the result. Another result, of course, is
the endless diversity of deities. Every race, every nation, every tribe, every household,
every heart, has had its own God. And yet, with all this multiplicity in religious
literature and dogma, subject and object, a unity co-exists which the student of the
science notes with profound interest. All nations of men are of one blood; and all forms
of God embody the one Eternal Spirit. To this unity mythology tends. As one writer says:
"We must ever bear in mind that the course of mythology is from many gods toward one,
that it is a synthesis, not an analysis, and that in this process the tendency is to
blend in one the traits and stories of originally separate divinities."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note107"><u>[107]</u></a> The ancient Hebrew worshipped God as "the Eternal, our
righteousness"; the Greek worshipped Him as wisdom and beauty; the Roman as power and
government; the Persian as light and goodness; and so forth. Few hymns have surpassed the
beauty of Pope's <i>Universal Prayer</i>. It is the <i>Te Deum laudamus</i> of that
catholic Church which embraces God-loved humanity.</p>

<blockquote>
"Father of all! in every age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;In every clime, adored,<br>
By saint, by savage, and by sage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!"
</blockquote>

<p>The Christian, believing his to be the "One Religion," as a recent Bampton Lecturer
termed it, too often forgets that his system is a recomposition of rays of a religious
light which was decomposed in the prismatic minds of earlier men. And further, with a
change of metaphor, if Christianity has flourished and fructified through eighteen
centuries, it must not be denied that it is a graft upon an old stock which through
fifteen previous centuries had borne abundant fruit. The same course must be adopted
still. We find men everywhere holding some truth; we add further truth; until, as a
chemist would say, we saturate the solution, which upon evaporation produces a
crystallized life of entirely new colour and quality and form. Thus Professor Nilsson
writes: "Every religious <i>change</i> in a people is, in fact, only an intermixture of
religions; because the new religion, whether received by means of convincing arguments,
or enforced by the eloquence of fire and sword, cannot <i>at once</i> tear up all the
wide-spreading roots by which its forerunner has grown in the heart of the people; this
must be the work of many years, perhaps of many generations."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note108"><u>[108]</u></a> We cannot better close this lengthy introduction than by
reminding Christians of the saying of their Great and Good Teacher, "I am not come to
destroy, but to fulfil."</p><br>
<a name="II2" id="II2"></a>II. THE MOON MOSTLY A MALE DEITY.<br>

<p>We have already in part pointed out that the moon has been considered as of the
masculine gender; and have therefore but to travel a little farther afield to show that
in the Aryan of India, in Egyptian, Arabian, Slavonian, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic,
Teutonic, Swedish, Anglo-Saxon, and South American, the moon is a male god. To do this,
in addition to former quotations, it will be sufficient to adduce a few authorities.
"Moon," says Max M&uuml;ller, "is a very old word. It was <i>m&oacute;na</i> in
Anglo-Saxon, and was used there, not as a feminine, but as a masculine for the moon was
originally a masculine, and the sun a feminine, in all Teutonic languages; and it is only
through the influence of classical models that in English moon has been changed into a
feminine, and sun into a masculine. It was a most unlucky assertion which Mr. Harris made
in his <i>Hermes</i>, that all nations ascribe to the sun a masculine, and to the moon a
feminine gender."&nbsp;<a href="#note109"><u>[109]</u></a> Grimm says, "Down to recent
times, our people were fond of calling the sun and moon <i>frau sonne</i> and <i>herr
mond</i>." &nbsp;<a href="#note110"><u>[110]</u></a> Sir Gardner Wilkinson writes:
"Another reason that the moon in the Egyptian mythology could not be related to Bubastis
is, that it was a male and not a female deity, personified in the god Thoth. This was
also the case in some religions of the West. The Romans recognised the god Lunus; and the
Germans, like the Arabs, to this day, consider the moon masculine, and not feminine, as
were the Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Luna of the Greeks and Latins."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note111"><u>[111]</u></a> Again, "The Egyptians represented their moon as a male deity,
like the German <i>mond</i> and <i>monat</i>, or the <i>Lunus</i> of the Latins; and it
is worthy of remark, that the same custom of calling it male is retained in the East to
the present day, while the sun is considered female, as in the language of the
Germans."&nbsp;<a href="#note112"><u>[112]</u></a> "In Slavonic," Sir George Cox tells
us, "as in the Teutonic mythology, the moon is male. His wedding with the sun brings on
him the wrath of Perkunas [the thunder-god], as the song tells us</p>

<blockquote>
'The moon wedded the sun<br>
In the first spring.<br>
The sun rose early<br>
The moon departed from her.<br>
The moon wandered alone;<br>
Courted the morning star.<br>
Perkunas, greatly wroth,<br>
Cleft him with a sword.<br>
'Wherefore dost thou depart from the sun,<br>
Wandering by night alone,<br>
Courting the morning star?'"&nbsp;<a href="#note113"><u>[113]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;In a Servian song a girl cries to the sun--</p>

<blockquote>
'O brilliant sun! I am fairer than thou<br>
Than thy brother, the bright moon.'&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In South Slavonian poetry the sun often figures as a radiant youth. But among
the northern Slavonians, as well as the Lithuanians, the sun was regarded as a
female being, the bride of the moon. 'Thou askest me of what race, of what
family I am,' says the fair maiden of a song preserved in the Tambof
Government--</p>

<blockquote>
'My mother is--the beauteous Sun,<br>
And my father--the bright Moon.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note114"><u>[114]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>"Among the Mbocobis of South America the moon is a man and the sun his
wife."&nbsp;<a href="#note115"><u>[115]</u></a> The Ahts of North America take the same
view; and we know that in Sanskrit and in Hebrew the word for moon is masculine.</p>

<p>This may seem to many a matter of no importance; but if mythology throws much light
upon ancient history and religion, its importance may be considerable, especially as it
lies at the root of that sexuality which has been the most prolific parent of both good
and evil in human life. The sexual relation has existed from the very birth of animated
nature; and it is remarkable that a man of learning and piety in Germany has made the
strange if not absurd statement that in the beginning "Adam was externally
sexless."&nbsp;<a href="#note116"><u>[116]</u></a> Another idea, more excusable, but
equally preposterous, is, that grammatical gender has been the cause of the male and
female personation of deities, when really it has been the result. The cause, no doubt,
was inherent in man's constitution; and was the inevitable effect of thought and
expression. The same necessity of natural language which led the Hebrew prophets to speak
of their land as married, of their nation as a wife in prosperity and a widow in
calamity, of their Maker as their husband, who rejoices over them as the bridegroom
rejoiceth over the bride:&nbsp;<a href="#note117"><u>[117]</u></a> this same necessity,
becoming a habit like that of our own country folks in Hampshire, of whom Cobbett speaks,
who call almost everything <i>he</i> or <i>she</i>; led the sensuous and imaginative
ancients, as it leads simple and poetical peoples still, to call the moon a man and to
worship him as a god. Objects of fear and reverence would be usually masculines; and
objects of love and desire feminines. We may thus find light thrown upon the honours paid
to such goddesses as Astarte and Aphrodite: which will also help us to understand the
deification by a celibate priesthood of the Virgin Mary. We may, moreover, account partly
for the fact that to the sailor his ship is always she; to the swain the flowers which
resemble his idol, as the lily and the rose, are always feminine, and used as female
names; while to the patriot the mother country is nearly always of the tender
sex.&nbsp;<a href="#note118"><u>[118]</u></a> Prof. Max M&uuml;ller thinks that the
distinction between males and females began, "not with the introduction of masculine
nouns, but with the introduction of feminines, <i>i.e.</i> with the setting apart of
certain derivative suffixes for females. By this all other words became
masculine."&nbsp;<a href="#note119"><u>[119]</u></a> Thus the sexual emotions of men
created that grammatical gender which has contributed so powerfully to our later
mythology, and has therefore been mistaken for the author of our male and female
personations. What beside sexuality suggested the thought of the Chevalier Marini? "He
introduces the god <i>Pan</i>, who boasts that the spots which are seen in the moon are
impressions of the kisses he gave it."&nbsp;<a href="#note120"><u>[120]</u></a> That
grammar is very much younger than sexual relations is proven by the curious fact
mentioned by Max M&uuml;ller that <i>pater</i> is not a masculine, nor <i>mater</i> a
feminine. Gender, we must not forget, is from <i>genus</i>, a kind or class; and that the
classification in various languages has been arranged on no fixed plan. We in our modern
English, with much still to do, have improved in this respect, since, in Anglo-Saxon,
<i>wif</i> = wife, was neuter, and <i>wif-mann</i> = woman, was masculine. In German
still <i>die frau</i>, the woman, is feminine; but <i>das weib</i>, the wife, is
neuter.&nbsp;<a href="#note121"><u>[121]</u></a> Dr. Farrar finds the root of gender in
the imagination: which we admit if associated with sex. Otherwise, we cannot understand
how an <i>unfelt</i> distinction of this sort could be mentally <i>seen</i>. But Dr.
Farrar means more than imagination, for he says, "from this source is derived the whole
system of genders for inanimate things, which was perhaps inevitable at that early
childish stage of the human intelligence, when the actively working soul attributed to
everything around it some portion of its own life. Hence, well-nigh everything is spoken
of as masculine or feminine."&nbsp;<a href="#note122"><u>[122]</u></a> We are surprised
that Dr. Farrar seems to think German an exception, in making a masculine noun of the
moon. He has failed to apply to this point his usual learned and laborious
investigation.&nbsp;<a href="#note123"><u>[123]</u></a></p>

<p>Diogenes Laertius describes the theology of the Jews as an offshoot from that of the
Chaldees, and says that the former affirm of the latter "that they condemn images, and
especially those persons who say that the gods are male and female."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note124"><u>[124]</u></a> Which condemnation implies the prevalence of this sexual
distinction between their deities.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter we think that it will be granted that gender in the
personification of inanimate objects was the result of sex in the animate subject: that
primitive men saw the moon as a most conspicuous object, whose spots at periods had the
semblance of a man's face, whose waxing and waning increased their wonder: whose coming
and going amid the still and solemn night added to the mystery: until from being viewed
as a man, it was feared, especially when apparently angry in a mist or an eclipse, and so
reverenced and worshipped as the heaven-man, the monthly god.</p><br>
<a name="II3" id="II3"></a>III. THE MOON A WORLD-WIDE DEITY.<br>

<p>Anthropomorphism, or the representation of outward objects in the <i>form</i> of
<i>man</i>, wrought largely, as we have seen, in the manufacture of the man in the moon;
it entered no less into the composition of the moon-god. The twenty-first verse of the
fiftieth Psalm contains its recognition and rebuke. "Thou thoughtest that I was
altogether as thyself"; or, still more literally, "Thou hast thought that being, I shall
be like thee." As Dr. Delitzsch says, "Because man in God's likeness has a bodily form,
some have presumed to infer backwards therefrom that God also has a bodily form like to
man, which is related by way of prototype to the human form."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note125"><u>[125]</u></a> As well might we say that because a watchmaker constructs a
chronometer with a movement somewhat like that of his own heart, therefore he is
mechanical, metallic, and round. Against this anthropomorphic materialism science lifts
up its voice; for what modern philosopher, worthy of the name, fails to distinguish
between phenomenon and fact, inert matter and active force? Says a recent writer, "We
infer that as our own master of the mint is neither a sovereign nor a half-sovereign, so
the force which coins and recoins this <font face="Times New Roman">&#965;</font>&#955;&#951;<font face="Tahoma">,</font>
or matter, must be altogether in the god-part and none of it in the metal or paste in
which it works."&nbsp;<a href="#note126"><u>[126]</u></a> With the progress of man's
intelligence we shall observe improvement in this anthropomorphism, but it will still
survive. As Mr. Baring-Gould tells us: "The savage invests God with bodily attributes; in
a more civilized state man withdraws the bodily attributes, but imposes the limitations
of his own mental nature; and in his philosophic elevation he recognises in God
intelligence only, though still with anthropomorphic conditions."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note127"><u>[127]</u></a></p>

<p>Xenophanes said that if horses, oxen, and lions could paint, they would make gods like
themselves. And Ralph Waldo Emerson says: "The gods of fable are the shining moments of
great men. We run all our vessels into one mould. Our colossal theologies of Judaism,
Christism, Buddhism, Mahometism, are the necessary and structural action of the human
mind. The student of history is like a man going into a warehouse to buy clothes or
carpets. He fancies he has a new article. If he go to the factory, he shall find that his
new stuff still repeats the scrolls and rosettes which are found on the interior walls of
the pyramids of Thebes. Our theism is the purification of the human mind. Man can paint,
or make, or think nothing but man. He believes that the great material elements had their
origin from his thought. And our philosophy finds one essence collected or
distributed."&nbsp;<a href="#note128"><u>[128]</u></a> And a devout author, whose
orthodoxy--whatever that may mean--is unquestioned, acknowledges that man
adored the unknown power in the sun, and "in the moon, which bathes the night with its
serene splendours. Under this latter form, completed by a very simple anthropomorphism
which applies to the gods the law of the sexes, the religions of nature weighed during
long ages upon Western Asia."&nbsp;<a href="#note129"><u>[129]</u></a> A volume might be
written upon this subject; but we have other work in hand.</p>

<p>It seems to be generally admitted that no form of idolatry is older than the worship
of the moon. Lord Kames says, "It is probable that the sun and moon were early held to be
deities, and that they were the first visible objects of worship."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note130"><u>[130]</u></a> Dr. Inman says, "That the sun and moon were at a very early
period worshipped, none who has studied antiquity can deny."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note131"><u>[131]</u></a> And Goldziher maintains that "the lunar worship is older than
the solar."&nbsp;<a href="#note132"><u>[132]</u></a> Maimonides, "the light of Israel,"
says that the Zabaists not only worshipped the moon themselves, but they also asserted
that Adam led mankind to that species of worship. No doubt luniolatry is as old as the
human race. In some parts the moon is still the superior god. Mr. Tylor writes: "Moon
worship, naturally ranking below sun worship in importance, ranges through nearly the
same district of culture. There are remarkable cases in which the moon is recognised as a
great deity by tribes who take less account, or none at all, of the sun. An old account
of the Caribs describes them as esteeming the moon more than the sun, and at new moon
coming out of their houses crying, Behold the moon!"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note133"><u>[133]</u></a> This deity, then, is ancient and modern: also a chief of the
gods: let us now show that he is a god whose empire is the world.</p>

<p>We begin in Asia, and with the Assyrian monuments, which display many religious types
and emblems. "Representations of the heavenly bodies, as sacred symbols, are of constant
occurrence in the most ancient sculptures. In the bas-reliefs we find figures of the sun,
moon, and stars, suspended round the neck of the king when engaged in the performance of
religious ceremonies."&nbsp;<a href="#note134"><u>[134]</u></a> In Chaldaea "the moon was
named Sin and Hur. Hurki, Hur, and Ur was the chief place of his worship, for the
satellite was then considered as being masculine. The name for the moon in Armenian was
<i>Khaldi</i>, which has been considered by some to be the origin of the word Chaldee, as
signifying moon worshippers."&nbsp;<a href="#note135"><u>[135]</u></a> With this
Chaldaean deity may be connected "the Akkadian moon god, who corresponds with the Semitic
Sin," and who "is Aku, 'the seated-father,' as chief supporter of kosmic order, styled
'the maker of brightness,' En-zuna, 'the lord of growth,' and Idu, 'the measuring lord,'
the A&iuml;d&ecirc;s of Hesychios."&nbsp;<a href="#note136"><u>[136]</u></a></p>

<p>&quot;With respect to the name of Chaldaean, perhaps the most probable account of
the origin of the word is, that it designates properly the inhabitants of the
ancient capital, Ur or Hur,--<i>Kkaldi</i> being in the Burbur dialect the exact equivalent
of <i>Hur</i>, which was the proper name of the moon god, and Chaldaeans being thus
either 'moon worshippers,' or simply, inhabitants of the town dedicated to, and called
after, the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note137"><u>[137]</u></a> Again: "The first god of the
second triad is Sin or Hurki, the moon deity. It is in condescension to Greek notions
that Berosus inverts the true Chaldaean order, and places the sun before the moon in his
enumeration of the heavenly bodies. Chaldaean mythology gives a very decided preference
to the lesser luminary, perhaps because the nights are more pleasant than the clays in
hot countries. With respect to the names of the god, we may observe that Sin, the
Assyrian or Semitic term, is a word of quite uncertain etymology, which, however, is
found applied to the moon in many Semitic languages." &nbsp;<a href=
"#note138"><u>[138]</u></a> "<i>Sin</i> is used for the moon in Mendaean and Syriac at
the present day. It is the name given to the moon god in St. James of Seruj's list of the
idols of Harran; and it was the term used for Monday by the Sabaeans as late as the ninth
century."&nbsp;<a href="#note139"><u>[139]</u></a> Another author writes: "The Babylonian
and Assyrian moon god is Sin, whose name probably appears in Sinai. The expression, 'from
the origin of the god Sin,' was used by the Assyrians to mark remote antiquity; because,
as chaos preceded order, so night preceded day, and the enthronement of the moon as the
night-king marks the commencement of the annals of kosmic order."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note140"><u>[140]</u></a></p>

<p>When we search the Hebrew Scriptures, we find too many allusions to the Queen of
Heaven, to Astarte and the groves, for us to doubt that the Israelites adored</p>

<blockquote>
"--moon&egrave;d Ashtaroth,<br>
Heaven's queen and mother both." (Milton's <i>Odes</i>.)
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Goldziher is an incontestable authority, and thus writes: "Queen or Princess of
Heaven is a very frequent name for the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note141"><u>[141]</u></a>
Again, "Even in the latest times the Hebrews called the moon the 'Queen of Heaven' (Jer.
vii. 18), and paid her Divine honours in this character at the time of the
captivity."&nbsp;<a href="#note142"><u>[142]</u></a> And, to complete this author's
witness, he again says: "What was the antiquity of this lunar worship among the Hebrews,
is testified (as has long been known) by the part played by Mount Sinai in the history of
Hebrew religion. For this geographical name is doubtless related to <i>Sin</i>, one of
the Semitic names of the moon. The mountain must in ancient times have been consecrated
to the moon. The beginning of the Hebrew religion, which was connected with the phenomena
of the night-sky, germinated first during the residence in Egypt on the foundation of an
ancient myth. The recollection of this occasioned them to call the part of Egypt which
they had long inhabited, eres S&icirc;n&icirc;m, 'moonland' (Isa. xlix.
12)."&nbsp;<a href="#note143"><u>[143]</u></a> It is but just that we should hear the
other side, when there is a difference of opinion. The above mentioned 'Queen of Heaven'
is beyond question the Ashtoreth or Astarte (identical with our <i>star</i>), which was
the principal goddess of the Phoenicians; and we believe she was originally the goddess
of the moon. This is doubted by a modern writer, who says, "Baal is constantly coupled
with Astarte; and the more philosophical opinion is that this national god and goddess
were the lord and lady of Phoenicia, rather than the sun and moon: for to a people full
of political life the sun and moon would have been themselves representatives, while a
Divine king and queen were the realities. And if so, the habitual inclination of the
Israelites, an essentially political people, for this worship becomes the more easily
understood."&nbsp;<a href="#note144"><u>[144]</u></a> Professor F. D. Maurice, in his
<i>Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy</i>, also takes this view. The question here is not
whether the Jews worshipped Astarte, but whether Astarte was the moon. This we cannot
hesitate to answer in the affirmative. Kenrick writes: "Ashtoreth or Astarte appears
physically to represent the moon. She was the chief local deity of Sidon; but her worship
must have been extensively diffused, not only in Palestine, but in the countries east of
the Jordan, as we find Ashtaroth-Karnaim (Ashtaroth of two horns) mentioned in the book
of Genesis (xiv. 5). This goddess, like other lunar deities, appears to have been
symbolized by a heifer, or a figure with a heifer's head, whose horns resembled the
crescent moon. The children of Israel renounced her worship at the persuasion of Samuel;
and we do not read again of her idolatry till the reign of Solomon (1 Kings xi. 5), after
which it appears never to have been permanently banished, though put down for a time by
Josiah (2 Kings xxiii. 13). She is the Queen of Heaven, to whom, according to the
reproaches of Jeremiah (vii. 18, xliv. 25), the women of Israel poured out their
drink-offerings, and burnt incense, and offered cakes, regarding her as the author of
their national prosperity. This epithet accords well with the supposition that she
represented the moon, as some ancient authors inform us."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note145"><u>[145]</u></a> Dr. Gotch, an eminent Hebrew scholar, says that there is no
doubt that the moon is the symbol of productive power and must be identified with
Astarte. "That this goddess was so typified can scarcely be doubted. The ancient name of
the city, Ashtaroth-Karnaim, already referred to, seems to indicate a horned Astarte,
that is an image with a crescent moon on her head like the Egyptian Athor. At any rate,
it is certain that she was by some ancient writers identified with the moon, as Lucian
and Herodian. On these grounds Movers, Winer, Keil, and others maintain that originally
Ashtoreth was the moon goddess."&nbsp;<a href="#note146"><u>[146]</u></a> Clearly, then,
the Hebrews worshipped the moon. But, even apart from Astarte, this worship may be proven
on other evidence. Dr. Jamieson says that the word <i>mena</i> (moon: Anglo-Saxon,
<i>mona</i>) "approaches most nearly to a word used by the prophet Isaiah, which has been
understood by the most learned interpreters as denoting the moon. 'Ye are they that
prepare a table for <i>Gad</i>, and that furnish the offering unto <i>Meni.</i>' (Isa.
lxv. 11). As <i>Gad</i> is understood of the <i>sun</i>, we learn from Diodor Sicul
that <i>Meni</i> is to be viewed as a designation of the <i>moon</i>."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note147"><u>[147]</u></a> This is Bishop Lowth's view. "The disquisitions and
conjectures of the learned concerning Gad and Meni are infinite and uncertain: perhaps
the most probable may be, that Gad means good fortune, and Meni the moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note148"><u>[148]</u></a> One point is worthy of notice. In our English version
<i>Meni</i> is rendered "number"; and we know very well that by the courses of the moon
ancient months and years were numbered. In Isaiah iii. 18 we find the daughters of Zion
ornamented with feet-rings, and networks, and <i>crescents</i>: or, as our translation
reads, "round tires like the moon." And, once more, in Ezekiel xlvi., we read that the
gate of the inner court of the sanctuary that "looketh toward the east, shall be opened
on the day of the new moon"; and the meat offering on "the day of the new moon shall be a
young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram." If there was no sacred
significance in the observance of these lunar changes, why did the writer of the New
Testament Epistle to the Colossians say, "Let no man judge you in respect of the new
moon"? A competent scholar, in recognising this consociation of Hebrew religion with the
moon's phases, rightly ascribes to it an earlier origin. Says Ewald: "To connect the
annual festivals with the full moon, and to commence them in the evening, as though
greeting her with a glad shout, was certainly a primitive custom, both among other races
and in the circle of nations from which in the earliest times Israel
sprang."&nbsp;<a href="#note149"><u>[149]</u></a> And the Bishop of Derry remarks: "To a
religious Hebrew it was rather the moon than the sun which marked the seasons, as the
calendar of the Church was regulated by it."&nbsp;<a href="#note150"><u>[150]</u></a> We
have sought to place this Hebrew luniolatry beyond dispute, because so many Christians
have supposed that "the chosen people" lived in unclouded light, and "the uncovenanted
heathen" in outer and utter darkness.</p>

<p>Passing on we find that "in Pontus and Phrygia were temples to <i>Meen</i>, and Homer
says <i>Meen</i> presides over the months, whilst in the Sanskrit <i>Mina</i>, we see her
connected with the Fish and Virgin. It is not improbable that the great Akaimenian race,
as worshipping and upholding sun and moon faiths, were called after <i>Meni</i>, the
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note151"><u>[151]</u></a> Among the Arabians the moon was the great
divinity, as may be learned from Pocock's <i>Specimen Historiae Arabum</i>; Prideaux's
<i>Connection</i>; Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>; and Sale's
<i>Preliminary Discourse</i> to his translation of the <i>Koran</i>. Tiele says: "The
ancient religion of the Arabs rises little higher than animistic polydaemonism. The names
Itah and Shamsh, the sun god, occur among all the Semitic peoples; All&acirc;t, or
Alil&acirc;t, and Al-Uzza, as well as the triad of moon goddesses to which these last
belong, are common to several, and the deities which bear them are reckoned among the
chief."&nbsp;<a href="#note152"><u>[152]</u></a> The Saracens called the moon
<i>Cabar</i>, the great; and its crescent is the religious symbol of the Turks to this
day. Tradition says that "Philip, the father of Alexander, meeting with great
difficulties in the siege of Byzantium, set the workmen to undermine the walls, but a
crescent moon discovered the design, which miscarried; consequently the Byzantines
erected a statue to Diana, and the crescent became the symbol of the state." Dr. Brewer,
who cites this story, adds: "Another legend is that Othman, the sultan, saw in a vision a
crescent moon, which kept increasing till its horns extended from east to west, and he
adopted the crescent of his dream for his standard, adding the motto, <i>Donec repleat
orbem</i>."&nbsp;<a href="#note153"><u>[153]</u></a> Schlegel mentions the story that
Mahomet "wished to pass with his disciples as a person transfigured in a supernatural
light, and that the credulity of his followers saw the moon, or the moon's light, descend
upon him, pierce his garments, and replenish him. That veneration for the moon which
still forms a national or rather religious characteristic of the Mahometans, may perhaps
have its foundation in the elder superstition, or pagan idolatry of the
Arabs."&nbsp;<a href="#note154"><u>[154]</u></a> No doubt this last sentence contains the
true elucidation of the crescent. For astrolatry lives in the east still. The
<i>Koran</i> may expressly forbid the practice, saying: "Bend not in adoration to the sun
or moon";&nbsp;<a href="#note155"><u>[155]</u></a> yet, "monotheist as he is, the Moslem
still claps his hands at sight of the new moon, and says a prayer."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note156"><u>[156]</u></a></p>

<p>We come next to the Persians, whom Herodotus accuses of adoring the sun and moon. But,
as Gibbon says, "the Persians of every age have denied the charge, and explained the
equivocal conduct, which might appear to give colour to it."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note157"><u>[157]</u></a> It will certainly require considerable explanation to free
from lunar idolatry the following passage, which we find in the <i>Zend Avesta</i>: "We
sacrifice unto the new moon, the holy and master of holiness: we sacrifice unto the full
moon, the holy and master of holiness."&nbsp;<a href="#note158"><u>[158]</u></a>
Unquestionably the Persian recognised the Lord of Light <i>in</i> the ordinances of
heaven; and therefore his was superior to many forms of blind idol-worship. So far we may
accept Hegel's interpretation of the <i>Zend</i> doctrine. "Light is the <i>body of
Ormuzd</i>; thence the worship of fire, because Ormuzd is present in all light; but he is
not the sun or moon itself In these the Persians venerate only the light, which is
Ormuzd."&nbsp;<a href="#note159"><u>[159]</u></a> In fact, we owe to the Persians a
valuable testimony to the God in whom is no darkness at all. "The prayer of Ajax was for
light"; and we too little feel the Fire which burns and shines beyond the stars.</p>

<p>In Central India the sun and moon are worshipped by many tribes, as the Khonds,
Kork&uacute;s, Tunguses, and Buraets. The Kork&uacute;s adore the powers of nature, as
the gods of the tiger, bison, the hill, the cholera, etc., "but these are all secondary
to the sun and the moon, which among this branch of the Kolarian stock, as among the Kols
in the far east, are the principal objects of adoration."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note160a"><u>[160a]</u></a> "Although the Tongusy in general worship the sun and moon,
there are many exceptions to this observation. I have found intelligent people among
them, who believed that there was a being superior to both sun and moon; and who created
them and all the world."&nbsp;<a href="#note160b"><u>[160b]</u></a> This last sentence we
read with gratitude, but not with surprise. There is some good in all, if there seem to
be all good in some.</p>

<p>"The aboriginal tribes in the Dekkan of India also acknowledge the presence of the sun
and moon by an act of reverence."&nbsp;<a href="#note161"><u>[161]</u></a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the island of Celebes, in the East Indian Archipelago, "formerly
acknowledged no gods but the sun and the moon, which were held to be eternal. Ambition
for superiority made them fall out."&nbsp;<a href="#note162"><u>[162]</u></a> According
to Milton, ambition created unpleasantness in the Hebrew heaven.</p>

<p>In Northern Asia the moon had adoring admirers among the Samoyedes, the Morduans, the
Tschuwasches, and other tribes. This is stated by Sir John Lubbock.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note163"><u>[163]</u></a> Lord Kames says: "The people of Borneo worship the sun and
moon as real divinities. The Samoides worship both, bowing to them morning and evening in
the Persian manner."&nbsp;<a href="#note164"><u>[164]</u></a> The <i>Samoides</i> are the
"salmon-eaters" of Asia.</p>

<p>Moon-worship in China is of ancient origin, and exists in our own time. Professor
Legge tells us that the primitive <i>shih</i> "is the symbol for manifestation and
revelation. The upper part of it is the same as that in the older form of T&icirc;,
indicating 'what is above'; but of the three lines below I have not found a satisfactory
account. Hs&uuml; Sh<font face="Times New Roman">&#259;n</font> says they represent 'the
sun, moon, and stars,' and that the whole symbolizes 'the indications by these bodies of
the will of Heaven! Shih therefore tells us that the Chinese fathers believed that there
was communication between heaven and men. The idea of revelation did not shock them. The
special interpretation of the strokes below, however, if it were established, would lead
us to think that even then, so far back, there was the commencement of astrological
superstition, and also, perhaps, of Sabian worship."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note165"><u>[165]</u></a> Sabianism, as most readers are aware, is the adoration of the
armies of heaven: the word being derived from the Hebrew <i>tzaba</i>, a host. Dr. Legge
leaves Chinese Sabianism in some doubt, in the above quotation; but later on he speaks of
the spirits associated with the solstitial worship, whose intercession was thus secured,
"I, the emperor of the Great Illustrious dynasty, have respectfully prepared this paper,
to inform the spirit of the sun, the spirit of the moon, the spirits of the five planets,
of the constellations of the zodiac, and of all the stars in all the sky," and so on: and
the professor adds: "This paper shows how there had grown up around the primitive
monotheism of China the recognition and worship of a multitude of celestial and
terrestrial spirits."&nbsp;<a href="#note166"><u>[166]</u></a> This is ample evidence to
prove moon-worship. True, these celestial beings were "but ministering spirits," and the
"monotheism remained." There was no <i>henotheism</i>, no worship of several
<i>single</i> supreme deities: <i>One only</i> was supreme. So among the Hebrews,
Persians, Hindoos, there was one only God; and yet they offered prayers and sacrifices to
heaven's visible and innumerable host. When we come to modern China we shall find some
very remarkable celebrations taking place, which throw sunlight upon these ancient mists.
Meanwhile to strengthen our position, we may draw additional support from each of the
three great stages reached in the progress of Chinese religion: namely, Confucianism,
Taoism, and Buddhism. Dr. Edkins describes them as the moral, materialistic, and
metaphysical systems, standing at the three corners of a great triangle.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note167"><u>[167]</u></a> The god of Confucianism is <i>Shang-t&icirc;</i> or
<i>Shang-te</i>. And with the universal anthropomorphism "Shang-te is the great father of
gods and men: Shang-te is a gigantic man."&nbsp;<a href="#note168"><u>[168]</u></a> Again
"Heaven is a great man, and man is a little heaven."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note169"><u>[169]</u></a> And now what does Confucianism say of moon-worship? "The sun
and moon being the chief objects of veneration to the most ancient ancestors of the
Chinese, they translated the soul of their great father heaven or the first man
(Shang-te) to the sun, and the soul of their great mother earth or the first woman (the
female half of the first man) to the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note170"><u>[170]</u></a> In
Taoism there is no room for question. Dr. Legge says that it had its Chang and Li&ucirc;,
and "many more gods, supreme gods, celestial gods, great gods, and divine
rulers."&nbsp;<a href="#note171"><u>[171]</u></a> And Dr. Edkins writes: "The Taouist
mythology resembles, in several points, that of many heathen nations. Some of its
divinities personate those beings that are supposed to reside in the various departments
of nature. Many of the stars are worshipped as gods."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note172"><u>[172]</u></a> Buddhism not only supplies further evidence, it also
furnishes a noteworthy instance of mythic transformation. Sakchi or Sasi, the moon, is
literally one who made a sacrifice. This refers to the legend of the hare who gave
himself to feed the god. The wife of Indra adopted the hare's name, and was herself
called Sasi. "The Tantra school gave every deity its Sakti or consort, and speculation
enlarged the meaning of the term still further, making it designate female energy or the
female principle."&nbsp;<a href="#note173"><u>[173]</u></a> Buddhism, then, the popular
religion in China at the present day, the religion which Dr. Farrar ventures to call
"atheism fast merging into idolatry,"&nbsp;<a href="#note174"><u>[174]</u></a> is not
free from the nature worship which deifies the moon. But Buddhism, like most other
imperfect systems, has precious gold mixed with its dross; and at the expense of a
digression we delight to quote the statement of a recent writer, who says: "There is no
record, known to me, in the whole of the long history of Buddhism, throughout the many
countries where its followers have been for such lengthened periods supreme, of any
persecution by the Buddhists of the followers of any other faith."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note175"><u>[175]</u></a> How glad we should feel if we could assert the same of the
Christian Church!</p>

<p>We come at once to those celebrations which still take place in China, and illustrate
the worship of the moon. The festival of <i>Yu&#277;-Ping</i>--which is held
annually during the eighth month, from the first day when the moon is new, to the
fifteenth, when it is full--is of high antiquity and of deep interest. Dr. Morrison
says that "the custom of civil and military officers going on the first and fifteenth of
every moon to the civil and military temples to burn incense, began in the time of the L&#365;h Chaon," which would be not far from A.D. 550. Also that the "eighth month,
fifteenth day, is called Chung-tsew-ts&euml;&euml;. It is said that the Emperor
Ming-hwang, of the dynasty Tang, was one night led to the palace of the moon, where he
saw a large assembly of Chang-go-s&euml;&euml;n-neu--female divinities playing on
instruments of music. Persons now, from the first to the fifteenth, make cakes like the
moon, of various sizes, and paint figures upon them: these are called Yu&#277;-ping,
'mooncakes.' Friends and relations pay visits, purchase and present the cakes to each
other, and give entertainments. At full moon they spread out oblations and make
prostrations to the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note176"><u>[176]</u></a> Dennys writes: "The
fifteenth day of the eighth month is a day on which a ceremony is performed by the
Chinese, which of all others we should least expect to find imitated among ourselves.
Most people resident in China have seen the moon-cakes which so delight the heart of the
Chinese during the eighth month of every year. These are made for an autumnal festival
often described as 'congratulating' or 'rewarding' the moon. The moon, it is well known,
represents the female principle in Chinese celestial cosmogony, and she is further
supposed to be inhabited by a multitude of beautiful females; the cakes made in her
honour are therefore veritable offerings to the Queen of the Heavens. Now in a part of
Lancashire, on the banks of the Ribble, there exists a precisely similar custom of making
cakes in honour of the 'Queen of Heaven,'--a relic, in all probability, of the old
heathen worship which was the common fount of the two customs."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note177"><u>[177]</u></a> Witness is also borne to this ceremony by a well-known
traveller. "We arrived at Chabort&eacute; on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, the
anniversary of great rejoicings among the Chinese. This festival, known as the
<i>Yu&#277;-Ping</i> (loaves of the moon), dates from the remotest antiquity. Its
original purpose was to honour the moon with superstitious rites. On this solemn day, all
labour is suspended; the workmen receive from their employers a present of money, every
person puts on his best clothes; and there is merry-making in every family. Relations and
friends interchange cakes of various sizes, on which is stamped the image of the moon;
that is to say, a hare crouching amid a small group of trees."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note178"><u>[178]</u></a> And Doolittle says: "It is always full moon on the fifteenth
of every Chinese month; and, therefore, for several days previous, the evenings are
bright, unless it happens to be cloudy, which is not often the case. The moon is a
prominent object of attention and congratulation at this time. At Canton, it is said,
offerings are made to the moon on the fifteenth. On the following day, young people amuse
themselves by playing what is called <i>'pursuing</i>,' or '<i>congratulating</i>' the
moon. At this city [Fuhchau], in the observance of this festival, the expression
'<i>rewarding the moon</i>' is more frequently used than 'congratulating the moon.' It is
a common saying that there is 'a white rabbit in the moon pounding out rice.' The dark
and the white spots on the moon's face suggest the idea of that animal engaged in the
useful employment of shelling rice. The notion is prevalent that the moon is inhabited by
a multitude of beautiful females, who are called by the name of an ancient beauty who
once visited that planet; but how they live, and what they do, is not a matter of
knowledge or of common fame. To the question, 'Is the moon inhabited?' discussed by some
Western philosophers, the Chinese would answer in the affirmative. Several species of
trees and flowers are supposed to flourish in the moon. Some say that, one night in
ancient times, one of the three souls of the originator of theatrical plays rambled away
to the moon and paid a visit to the Lunar Palace. He found it filled with Lunarians
engaged in theatrical performances. He is said to have remembered the manner of
conducting fashionable theatres in the moon, and to have imitated them after his return
to this earth. About the time of the festival of the middle of autumn, the bake shops
provide an immense amount and variety of cakes: many of them are circular, in imitation
of the shape of the moon at that time, and are from six to twelve inches in diameter.
Some are in the form of a pagoda, or of a horse and rider, or of a fish, or other animals
which please and cause the cake to be readily sold. Some of these 'moon-cakes' have a
white rabbit, engaged with his pounder, painted on one side, together with a lunar
beauty, and some trees or shrubs; on others are painted gods or goddesses, animals,
flowers, or persons, according to fancy."&nbsp;<a href="#note179"><u>[179]</u></a></p>

<p>If we turn now to Jeremiah vii. 18, and read there, "The women knead dough, to make
cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods," and
remember that, according to Rashi, these cakes of the Hebrews had the image of the god or
goddess stamped upon them, we are in view of a fact of much interest. We are so
unaccustomed to think that our peasants in Lancashire can have anything in common with
the Chinese five thousand miles away, and with the Jews of two thousand five hundred
years ago, that to many these moon-cakes will give a genuine surprise. But this is not
all. Other analogies appear between Buddhist and Christian rites, such as those mentioned
by Dr. Medhurst. "The very titles of their intercessors, such as 'goddess of mercy,'
'holy mother,' 'queen of heaven,' with the image of a virgin, having a child in her arms,
holding a cross, are all such striking coincidences, that the Catholic missionaries were
greatly stumbled at the resemblance between the Chinese worship and their own, when they
came over to convert the natives to Christianity."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note180"><u>[180]</u></a> It is for the philosophical historian to show, if possible,
whether these Chinese ceremonies are copies of Christian or Hebrew originals; or whether,
many of our own Western forms with others of Oriental character, are not transcripts of
primitive faiths now well-nigh forgotten in both East and West. The hot cross buns of
Good Friday, at first sight, have little relevancy to moon worship, and those who eat
them suppose they were originated to commemorate the Christian Sacrifice; but we know
that the cross was a sacred symbol with the earliest Egyptians, for it is carved upon
their imperishable records; we know too that <i>bun</i> itself is ancient Greek, and that
Winckelmann relates the discovery at Herculaneum of two perfect buns, each marked with a
cross: while the <i>boun</i> described by Hesychius was a cake with a representation of
<i>two horns</i>. Incredible as it may seem to some, the cross bun in its origin had
nothing to do with an event with which it is in England identified; it probably
commemorates the worship of the moon. In passing from China, we may also note the
influence of that sexuality of which we have spoken before. Dr. Medhurst remarks: "The
principle of the Chinese cosmogony seems to be founded on a sexual system of the
universe."&nbsp;<a href="#note181"><u>[181]</u></a></p>

<p>Dr. Prichard tells us that among the Japanese "sacred festivals are held at certain
seasons of the year and at changes of the moon." Also, "It appears that <i>Sin-too</i>,
or original Japanese religion, is merely a form of the worship of material objects,
common to all the nations of Northern Asia, which, among the more civilized tribes,
assumes the aspect of mythology."&nbsp;<a href="#note182"><u>[182]</u></a></p>

<p>From Asia we come to Africa, and to Egypt, that wonderful land with a lithographed
history at least five thousand years old; a land that basked in the sunshine of
civilization and culture when nearly the whole world without was in shadow and gloom. The
mighty pyramid of Gizeh still stands, a monument of former national greatness, and a
marvel to the admirer of sublimity in design and perfection in execution. "The setting of
the sides to the cardinal points is so exact as to prove that the Egyptians were
excellent observers of the elementary facts of astronomy."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note183"><u>[183]</u></a> But they went farther. Diodorus says: "The first generation
of men in Egypt, contemplating the beauty of the superior world, and admiring with
astonishment the frame and order of the universe, judged that there were two chief gods
that were eternal, that is to say, the sun and the moon, the first of which they called
<i>Osiris</i>, and the other <i>Isis</i>."&nbsp;<a href="#note184"><u>[184]</u></a> This
passage is proof that the Greeks and Romans had a very limited acquaintance with Egyptian
mythology; for the historian was indubitably in error in supposing Osiris and Isis to be
sun and moon. But he was right in calling the sun and moon the first gods of the
Egyptians. Rawlinson says: "The Egyptians had two moon-gods, Khons or Khonsu, and Tet or
Thoth."&nbsp;<a href="#note185"><u>[185]</u></a> Dr. Birch has translated an inscription
relating to Thoth, which reads: "All eyes are open on thee, and all men worship thee as a
god."&nbsp;<a href="#note186"><u>[186]</u></a> And M. Renouf says: "The Egyptian god
Tehuti is known to the readers of Plato under the name of Th<font face=
"Times New Roman">&#333;yth</font>. He represents the moon, which he wears upon his head,
either as crescent or as full disk."&nbsp;<a href="#note187"><u>[187]</u></a> The same
learned Egyptologist tells us that Khonsu or Chonsu was one of the triad of Theban gods,
and was the moon one of his attributes being the reckoner of time.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note188"><u>[188]</u></a> Of the former divinity, Rawlinson relates an instructive
myth. "According to one legend Thoth once wrote a wonderful book, full of wisdom and
science, containing in it everything relating to the fowls of the air, the fishes of the
sea, and the four-footed beasts of the mountains. The man who knew a single page of the
work could charm the heaven, the earth, the great abyss, the mountains and the seas. This
marvellous composition he inclosed in a box of gold, which he placed within a box of
silver; the box of silver within a box of ivory and ebony, and that again within a box of
bronze; the box of bronze within a box of brass; and the box of brass within a box of
iron; and the book, thus guarded, he threw into the Nile at Coptos. The fact became
known, and the book was searched for and found. It gave its possessor vast knowledge and
magical power, but it always brought on him misfortune. What became of it ultimately does
not appear in the manuscript from which this account is taken; but the moral of the story
seems to be the common one, that unlawful knowledge is punished by all kinds of
calamity."&nbsp;<a href="#note189"><u>[189]</u></a> There is also a story of the moon-god
Chonsu, which is worthy of repetition. Its original is in the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale</i> at Paris, and for its first translation we are indebted to Dr. Birch, of
the British Museum.&nbsp;<a href="#note190"><u>[190]</u></a> A certain Asiatic princess
of Bechten, wherever that was, was possessed by a spirit. Being connected, through her
sister's marriage, with the court of Egypt, on her falling ill, an Egyptian practitioner
was summoned to her aid. He declared that she had a demon, with which he himself was
unable to cope. Thereupon the image of the moon-god Chonsu was despatched in his mystic
ark, for the purpose of exorcising the spirit and delivering the princess. The demon at
once yielded to the divine influence; and the king of Bechten was so delighted that he
kept the image in his possession for upwards of three years. In consequence of an
alarming dream he then sent him back to Egypt with presents of great value. Whatever evil
powers the moon may have exerted since, we must credit him with having once ejected an
evil spirit and prolonged a royal life.</p>

<p>Returning to Thoth, we find the following valuable hints in the great work of Baron
Bunsen:--"The connection between Tet and the moon may allude, according to
Wilkinson, to the primitive use of a lunar year. The ancients had already remarked that
the moon in Egyptian was masculine, not feminine, as the Greeks and Romans generally made
it. Still we have no right to suppose a particular moon-god, separate from Thoth. We meet
with a deity called after the moon (Aah) either as a mere personification, or as Thoth,
in whom the agency of the moon and nature become a living principle. We find him so
represented in the tombs of the Ramesseum, opposite to Phre; a similar representation in
Dendyra is probably symbolical. According to Champollion he is often seen in the train of
Ammon, and then he is Thoth. He makes him green, with the four sceptres and cup of Ptah,
by the side of which, however, is a sort of Horus curl, the infantine lock, as child or
son. In the inscriptions there is usually only the crescent, but on one occasion the sign
<i>nuter</i> (god) is added. In the tombs a moon-god is represented sitting on a bark,
and holding the sceptre of benign power, to whom two Cynocephali are doing homage,
followed by the Crescent and Nuter god. Lastly, the same god is found in a standing
posture, worshipped by two souls and two Cynocephali."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note191"><u>[191]</u></a></p>

<p>With these "dog-headed" worshippers of the moon may be associated another animal that
from an early date has been connected with the luminaries of the day and night. We saw
that the Australian moon-myth of Mityan was of a native cat. Renouf says: "It is not
improbable that the cat, in Egyptian <i>m&auml;u</i>, became the symbol of the Sun-god,
or Day, because the word m&auml;u also means light."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note192"><u>[192]</u></a> Charles James Fox, with no thought of Egyptian, told the
Prince of Wales that "cats always prefer the sunshine." The native land of this domestic
pet, or nuisance, is certainly Persia, and some etymologists assign <i>pers</i> as the
origin of <i>puss</i>. Be this as it may, the pupil of a cat's eye is singularly
changeable, dilating from the narrow line in the day-time to the luminous orb in the
dark. On this account the cat is likened to the moon. But in Egypt feline eyes shine with
supernatural lustre. Mr. Hyde Clarke tells us that "the mummies of cats, which Herodotus
saw at Bubastis, attested then, as they do now, to the dedication of the cat to Pasht,
the moon, and the veneration of the Egyptians for this animal. The cat must have been
known to man, and have been named at least as early as the origin of language. The
superstition of its connection with the moon is also of pre-historic date, and not
invented by the Egyptians. According to Plutarch, a cat placed in a lustrum denoted the
moon, illustrating the mutual symbology. He supposes that this is because the pupils of a
cat's eyes dilate and decrease with the moon. The reason most probably depends, as before
intimated, on another phenomenon of periodicity corresponding to the month. Dr. Rae has,
however, called my attention to another possible cause of the association, which is the
fact that the cat's eyes glisten at night or in the dark. It is to be observed that the
name of the sun in the Malayan and North American languages is the day-eye, or sky-eye,
and that of the moon the night-eye."&nbsp;<a href="#note193"><u>[193]</u></a> Our own
daisy, too, is the <i>day's eye</i>, resembling the sun, and opening its little pearly
lashes when the spring wakes to newness of life.</p>

<p>The Nubians "pay adoration to the moon; and that their worship is performed with
pleasure and satisfaction, is obvious every night that she shines. Coming out from the
darkness of their huts, they say a few words upon seeing her brightness, and testify
great joy, by motions of their feet and hands, at the first appearance of the new
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note194"><u>[194]</u></a> The Shangalla worship the moon, and think
that "a star passing near the horns of the moon denotes the coming of an
enemy."&nbsp;<a href="#note195"><u>[195]</u></a> In Western Africa moon-worship is very
prevalent. Merolla says: "They that keep idols in their houses, every first day of the
moon are obliged to anoint them with a sort of red wood powdered. At the appearance of
every new moon, these people fall on their knees, or else cry out, standing and clapping
their hands, 'So may I renew my life as thou art renewed.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note196"><u>[196]</u></a></p>

<p>H. H. Johnston, Esq., F.Z.S., F.R.G.S., who had just returned from the region of the
Congo, related the following curious incident before the Anthropological Institute, in
January, 1884. It looks remarkably like a relic of ancient worship, which gave the fruit
of the body for the sin of the soul, and committed murder on earth to awaken mercy in
heaven! "At certain villages between Manyanga and Isangila there are curious eunuch
dances to celebrate the new moon, in which a white cock is thrown up into the air alive,
with clipped wings, and as it falls towards the ground it is caught and plucked by the
eunuchs. I was told that originally this used to be a human sacrifice, and that a young
boy or girl was thrown up into the air and torn to pieces by the eunuchs as he or she
fell, but that of late years slaves had got scarce or manners milder, and a white cock
was now substituted."&nbsp;<a href="#note197"><u>[197]</u></a></p>

<p>The Mandingoes are more attracted to the varying moon than to the sun. "On the first
appearance of the new moon, which they look upon to be newly created, the Pagan natives,
as well as Mahomedans, say a short prayer; and this seems to be the only visible
adoration which the Kaffirs offer up to the Supreme Being." The purport of this prayer is
"to return thanks to God for His kindness through the existence of the past moon, and to
solicit a continuation of His favour during that of the new one."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note198"><u>[198]</u></a> Park writes on another page: "When the fast month was almost
at an end, the Bushreens assembled at the Misura to watch for the appearance of the new
moon; but the evening being rather cloudy, they were for some time disappointed, and a
number of them had gone home with a resolution to fast another day, when on a sudden this
delightful object showed her sharp horns from behind a cloud, and was welcomed with the
clapping of hands, beating of drums, firing muskets, and other marks of
rejoicing."&nbsp;<a href="#note199"><u>[199]</u></a> The Makololo and Bechuana custom of
greeting the new moon is curious. "They watch most eagerly for the first glimpse of the
new moon, and when they perceive the faint outline after the sun has set deep in the
west, they utter a loud shout of 'Ku<font face="Times New Roman">&#257;</font>!' and
vociferate prayers to it."&nbsp;<a href="#note200"><u>[200]</u></a> The degraded
Hottentots have not much improved since Bory de St. Vincent described them as "brutish,
lazy, and stupid," and their worship of the moon is still demonstrative, as when Kolben
wrote: "These dances and noises are religious honours and invocations to the moon. They
call her <i>Gounja</i>. The Supreme they call <i>Gounja-Gounja</i>, or <i>Gounja</i>
<i>Ticquoa</i>, the god of gods, and place him far above the moon. The moon, with them,
is an inferior visible god--the subject and representation of the High and
Invisible. They judge the moon to have the disposal of the weather, and invoke her for
such as they want. They assemble for the celebration of her worship at full and change
constantly. No inclemency of the weather prevents them. And their behaviour at those
times is indeed very astonishing. They throw their bodies into a thousand different
distortions, and make mouths and faces strangely ridiculous and horrid. Now they throw
themselves flat on the ground, screaming out a strange, unintelligible jargon. Then
jumping up on a sudden, and stamping like mad (insomuch that they make the ground shake),
they direct, with open throats, the following expressions, among others, to the moon:
'<i>I salute you; you are welcome. Grant us fodder for our cattle and milk in
abundance</i>.' These and other addresses to the moon they repeat over and over,
accompanying them with dancing and clapping of hands. At the end of the dance they sing
'<i>Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!</i>' many times over, with a variation of notes; which being
accompanied with clapping of hands makes a very odd and a very merry entertainment to a
stranger."&nbsp;<a href="#note201"><u>[201]</u></a> In reality they hold a primitive
watch-night service; their welcome of the new moon being very similar to our popular
welcome of the new year. Nor should it be omitted that the ancient Ethiopians worshipped
the moon; and that those who lived above Mero&euml; admitted the existence of eternal and
incorruptible gods, among which the moon ranked as a chief divinity.</p>

<p>Descending the Nile and crossing the Mediterranean, we come to Greece.</p>

<blockquote>
"The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br>
Where grew the arts of war and peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung<br>
Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But all, except their sun, is set."&nbsp;<a href="#note202"><u>[202]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Pericles and Plato, Sophocles and Pheidias, are dust; and much of their nation's
pristine glory has "melted into the infinite azure of the past": but the sun shines as
youthful yet as on that eventful day when unwearied he sank in ocean, "loth, and ere his
time:</p>

<blockquote>
"So the sun sank, and all the host had rest<br>
From onset and the changeful chance of war."&nbsp;<a href="#note203"><u>[203]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Where Phoebus sprang, sprang Phoebe also--the bright and beautiful moon. To a
people addicted to the idolatry of perfect form and comeliness, no object could be more
attractive than the queen of the night. When Socrates was accused of innovating upon the
Greek religion, and of ridiculing the Athenian deities, he replied on his trial, "You
strange man, Mel&ecirc;tus, are you seriously affirming that I do not think Helios and
Selene to be gods, as the rest of mankind think?"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note204"><u>[204]</u></a> Pausanias, the historian, tells us that in Phocis there was a
chapel consecrated to Isis, which of all the places erected by the Greeks to this
Egyptian goddess was by far the most holy. It was not lawful for any one to approach this
sacred edifice but those whom the goddess had invited by appearing to them for that
purpose in a dream.&nbsp;<a href="#note205"><u>[205]</u></a> By Isis, as we saw from
Diodorus, the Greeks understood the moon. Diana was also one of the Grecian
moon-goddesses, but Sir George C. Lewis thinks that this was not till a comparatively
late period. The religion of Greece was so mixed up, or made up, with mythology, that for
an interpretation of their theogony we must resort to poetry and impersonation. Here
again we see the working of sexual anthropomorphism. <i>Ouranos</i> espoused <i>Ge</i>,
and their offspring was <i>Kronos</i>; which is but an ancient mode of saying that
chronology is the measurement on earth of heavenly motion. Solar and lunar worship was
but the recognition in the primitive consciousness of the superior <i>worth-ship</i> of
these celestial bodies. As Grote says: "To us these now appear puerile, though pleasing
fancies, but to our Homeric Greek they seemed perfectly natural and plausible. In his
view, the description of the sun, as given in a modern astronomical treatise, would have
appeared not merely absurd, but repulsive and impious."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note206"><u>[206]</u></a> What an amount of misunderstanding would be obviated if
readers of the Bible would bear this in mind when they meet with erroneous conceptions in
Hebrew cosmogony. Grote further says on the same page of his magnificent history:
"Personifying fiction was blended by the Homeric Greeks with their conception of the
physical phenomena before them, not simply in the way of poetical ornament, but as a
genuine portion of their everyday belief." We cannot better conclude our brief glance at
ancient Greece than by quoting that splendid comparison from the bard of Chios, which
Pope thought "the most beautiful night-piece that can be found in poetry." Pope's own
version is fine, but, as a translation, Lord Derby's must be preferred:</p>

<blockquote>
"As when in heaven, around the glittering moon<br>
The stars shine bright amid the breathless air;<br>
And every crag and every jutting peak<br>
Stands boldly forth, and every forest glade<br>
Even to the gates of heaven is opened wide<br>
The boundless sky; shines each particular star<br>
Distinct; joy fills the gazing shepherd's heart."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note207"><u>[207]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The Romans had many gods, superior and inferior. The former were the <i>celestial</i>
deities, twelve in number, among whom was Diana; and the <i>Dii Selecti</i>, numbering
eight. Of these, one was Luna, the moon, daughter of Hyperion and sister of the
Sun.&nbsp;<a href="#note208"><u>[208]</u></a> Livy speaks of "a temple of Luna, which is
on the Aventine"; and Tacitus mentions, in his Annals, a temple consecrated to the moon.
In Horace, Luna is "<i>siderum regina</i>";&nbsp;<a href="#note209"><u>[209]</u></a> and
in Apuleius, "<i>Regina coeli</i>,"&nbsp;<a href="#note210"><u>[210]</u></a> Bishop
Warburton, in his synopsis of Apuleius, speaks of the hopeless condition of
<i>Lucius</i>, which obliged him to fly to heaven for relief. "The <i>moon</i> is in full
splendour; and the awful silence of the night inspires him with sentiments of religion."
He then purifies himself, and so makes his prayer to the moon, invoking her by her
several names, as the celestial <i>Venus</i> and <i>Diana</i>.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note211"><u>[211]</u></a> This whole section of the <i>Divine Legation</i> is worthy of
close study.</p>

<p>"The ancient Goths," says Rudbeck ("Atalantis," ii. 609), "paid such regard to the
moon, that some have thought that they worshipped her more than the sun."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note212"><u>[212]</u></a></p>

<p>And of the ancient Germans Grimm says: "That to our remote ancestry the heavenly
bodies, especially the sun and moon, were divine beings, will not admit of any
doubt."&nbsp;<a href="#note213"><u>[213]</u></a> Gibbon, Friedrich Schlegel, and others,
say the same.</p>

<p>The Finns worshipped "Kun, the male god of the moon, who corresponded exactly with the
Aku, Enizuna, or Itu of the Accadians."&nbsp;<a href="#note214"><u>[214]</u></a></p>

<p>In ancient Britain the moon occupied a high position in the religion of the Druids,
who had superstitious rites at the lunar changes, and who are "always represented as
having the crescent in their hands."&nbsp;<a href="#note215"><u>[215]</u></a> "From the
<i>Penitential</i> of Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the seventh century, and the
<i>Confessional</i> of Ecgbert, Archbishop of York, in the early part of the eighth
century, we may infer that homage was then offered to the sun and moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note216"><u>[216]</u></a> Again, "There are many proofs, direct and circumstantial,
that place it beyond all doubt that the moon was one of the objects of heathen worship in
Britain. But under what name the moon was invoked is not discoverable, unless it may have
been Andraste, the goddess to whom the British queen Boadicea, with hands outstretched to
heaven, appealed when about to engage in battle with the Romans."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note217"><u>[217]</u></a> A writer of the seventeenth century, says: "In Yorkeshire,
etc., northwards, some country woemen do-e worship the New Moon on their bare knees,
kneeling upon an earthfast stone. And the people of Athol, in the High-lands in Scotland,
doe worship the New Moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note218"><u>[218]</u></a> Camden writes of the
Irish: "Whether or no they worship the moon, I know not; but, when they first see her
after the change, they commonly bow the knee, and say the Lord's Prayer; and near the
wane, address themselves to her with a loud voice, after this manner: 'Leave us as well
as thou foundest us.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note219"><u>[219]</u></a> Sylvester O'Halloran, the
Irish general and historian, speaking of "the correspondent customs of the Phoenicians
and the Irish," adds: "Their deities were the same. They both adored Bel, or the sun, the
Moon, and the stars. The house of Rimmon (2 Kings v. 18), which the Phoenicians
worshipped in, like our temples of Fleachta, in Meath, was sacred to the moon. The word
'Rimmon' has by no means been understood by the different commentators; and yet by
recurring to the Irish (a branch of the Phoenicians) it becomes very intelligible; for
<i>Re</i> is Irish for the moon, and <i>Muadh</i> signifies an image; and the compound
word <i>Reamham</i> signifies prognosticating by the appearances of the moon. It appears
by the life of our great St. Columba, that the Druid temples were <i>here</i> decorated
with figures of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The Phoenicians, under the name of
Bel-Samen, adored the Supreme; and it is pretty remarkable that <i>to this very day</i>,
to wish a friend every happiness this life can afford, we say in Irish, '<i>the blessings
of Samen and Eel be with you</i>!' that is, of all the seasons; Bel signifying the sun,
and Samhain the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note220"><u>[220]</u></a> And again: "Next to the
sun was the moon, which the Irish undoubtedly adored. Some remains of this worship may be
traced, even at this day; as particularly borrowing, if they should not have it about
them, a piece of silver on the first night of a new moon, as an omen of plenty during the
month; and at the same time saying in Irish, 'As you have found us in peace and
prosperity, so leave us in grace and mercy.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note221"><u>[221]</u></a>
Tuathal, the prince to whom the estates (<i>circa</i> A.D. 106) swore solemnly "by the
sun, moon, and stars," to bear true allegiance, "in that portion of the imperial domain
taken from Munster, erected a magnificent temple called Flachta, sacred to the fire of
Samhain, and to the Samnothei, or priests of the moon. Here, on every eve of November,
were the fires of Samhain lighted up, with great pomp and ceremony, the monarch, the
Druids, and the chiefs of the kingdom attending; and from this holy fire, and no other,
was every fire in the land first lit for the winter. It was deemed an act of the highest
impiety to kindle the winter fires from any other; and for this favour the head of every
house paid a Scrubal, or threepence, tax, to the Arch-Druid of Samhain."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note222"><u>[222]</u></a> Another writer mentions another Irish moon-god. "The next
heathen divinity which I would bring under notice is St. Luan, <i>alias</i> Molua,
<i>alias</i> Euan, <i>alias</i> Lugidus, <i>alias</i> Lugad, and Moling, etc. The
foundations, with which this saint under some of his <i>aliases</i> is connected, extend
over eight counties in the provinces of Ulster, Leinster, and Munster. Luan is to this;
day the common Irish word for the moon. We read that there were fifteen saints of the
name of Lugadius; and as Lugidus was one of Luan's <i>aliases</i>, I have set them all
down as representing the moon in the several places where that planet was worshipped as
the symbol of Female nature."&nbsp;<a href="#note223"><u>[223]</u></a> We have already
seen that the moon was the embodiment of the female principle in China, and now we see
that the primitive Kelts associated sexuality with astronomy and religion. It but further
proves that "one touch of nature makes the whole world kin."</p>

<p>Moreover, to show that former moon-worship still colours our religion, it is not to be
overlooked that, as our Christmas festivities are but a continuation of the Roman
saturnalia, with their interchanges of visits and presents, so "the Church, celebrating
in August the festival of the harvest moon, celebrates at the same time the feast of the
Assumption and of the Sacred Heart of the Virgin. And Catholic painters, following the
description in the Apocalypse, fondly depict her as 'clothed with the sun, and having the
moon under her feet,' and both as overriding the dragon. Even the triumph of Easter is
not celebrated until, by attaining its full, the moon accords its aid and sanction. Is it
not interesting thus to discover the true note of Catholicism in the most ancient
paganisms, and to find that the moon, which for us is incarnate in the blessed Virgin
Mary, was for the Syrians and Greeks respectively personified in the virgin Ashtoreth,
the queen of heaven, and Diana, or Phoebe, the feminine of Phoebus?"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note224"><u>[224]</u></a></p>

<p>A recent contributor to one of our valuable serials writes: "I take the following
extract from a little book published under the auspices of Dr. Barnardo. It is the
'truthful narrative' of a little sweep-girl picked up in the streets of some place near
Brighton, and 'admitted into Dr. Barnardo's Village Home.' 'She had apparently no
knowledge of God or sense of His presence. The only thing she had any reverence for was
the moon. On one occasion, when the children were going to evening service, and a
beautiful moon was shining, one of them pointed to it, exclaiming, 'Oh, mother! look,
what a beautiful moon!' Little Mary caught hold of her hand, and cried, 'Yer mustn't
point at the blessed moon like that; and yer mustn't talk about it!' Was it from
constantly sleeping under hedges and in barns, and waking up and seeing that bright calm
eye looking at her, that some sense of a mysterious Presence had come upon the
child?"&nbsp;<a href="#note225"><u>[225]</u></a> To this query, the answer we think
should be negative. The cause more likely was that she had heard the common tradition
which is yet current in East Lancashire, Cumberland, and elsewhere, that it is a sin to
point at the moon. Certain old gentlemen, who ought to be better informed, still touch
their hats, and devout young girls in the country districts still curtsey, to the new
moon, as an act of worship.</p>

<p>The American races practise luniolatry very generally. The Dakotahs worship both sun
and moon. The Delaware and Iroquois Indians sacrifice to these orbs, and it is most
singular that "they sacrifice to a hare, because, according to report, the first ancestor
of the Indian tribes had that name." But, although they receive in a dream as their
tutelar spirits, the sun, moon, owl, buffalo, and so forth, "they positively deny that
they pay any adoration to these subordinate good spirits, and affirm that they only
worship the true God, through them."&nbsp;<a href="#note226"><u>[226]</u></a> This
reminds us of some excellent remarks made by one whose intimate acquaintance with North
American Indians entitled him to speak with authority. We have seen from Dr. Legge's
writings that though the Chinese worshipped a multitude of celestial spirits, "yet the
monotheism remained." Mr. Catlin will now assure us that though the American Indians
adore the heavenly bodies, they recognise the Great Spirit who inhabits them all. These
are his words: "I have heard it said by some very good men, and some who have even been
preaching the Christian religion amongst them, that they have no religion--that all
their zeal in their worship of the Great Spirit was but the foolish excess of ignorant
superstition--that their humble devotions and supplications to the sun and the moon,
where many of them suppose that the Great Spirit resides, were but the absurd rantings of
idolatry. To such opinions as these I never yet gave answer, nor drew other instant
inferences from them, than that, from the bottom of my heart, I pitied the persons who
gave them."&nbsp;<a href="#note227"><u>[227]</u></a> Mr. Catlin undoubtedly was right, as
the Apostle Paul was right, when he acknowledged that the Athenians worshipped the true
God, albeit in ignorance. At the same time, though idolatry is in numberless instances
nothing more than the use of media and mediators, in seeking the One, Invisible, Absolute
Spirit, it is so naturally abused by sensuous beings who rest in the concrete, that no
image worshipper is free from the propensity to worship the creature more than the
Creator, and to forget the Essence in familiarity with the form. The perfection of
worship, we conceive, is pure theism; but how few are capable of breathing in such a
supersensuous air! Men must have their "means of grace," their visible symbols, their
holy waters and consecrated wafers, their crucifixes and talismans, their silver shrines
and golden calves. "These be thy gods, O Israel."</p>

<p>"The Ahts undoubtedly worship the sun and the moon, particularly the full moon, and
the sun while ascending to the zenith. Like the Teutons, they regard the moon as the
husband, and the sun as the wife; hence their prayers are more generally addressed to the
moon, as being the superior deity. The moon is the highest of all the objects of their
worship; and they describe the moon--I quote the words of my Indian
informant--as looking down upon the earth in answer to prayer, and as seeing
everybody."&nbsp;<a href="#note228"><u>[228]</u></a> Of the Indians of Vancouver Island,
another writer says: "The moon is among all the heavenly bodies the highest object of
veneration. When working at the settlement at Alberni in gangs by moonlight, individuals
have been observed to look up to the moon, blow a breath, and utter quickly the word,
'<i>Teech! teech!</i>' (health, or life). Life! life! this is the great prayer of these
people's hearts."&nbsp;<a href="#note229"><u>[229]</u></a> "Among the Comanches of Texas,
the sun, moon, and earth are the principal objects of worship." The Kaniagmioutes
consider the moon and sun to be brother and sister.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note230"><u>[230]</u></a></p>

<p>Meztli was the moon as deified by the Mexicans. In Teotihuacan, thirty miles north of
the city of Mexico, is the site of an ancient city twenty miles in circumference. Near
the centre of this spot stand the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. The
Pyramid of the Sun has a base 682 feet long and is 180 feet high (the Pyramid of Cheops
is 728 feet at the base, and is 448 feet in height). The Pyramid of the Moon is rather
less, and is due north of that of the Sun.&nbsp;<a href="#note231"><u>[231]</u></a> No
doubt the philosophy of all pyramids would show that they embody the uplifting of the
human soul towards the Heaven-Father of all.</p>

<p>In Northern Mexico still "the Ceris superstitiously celebrate the new
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note232"><u>[232]</u></a> This luniolatry the Abb&eacute; Brasseur
de Bourbourg explains by a novel theory. He holds that the forefathers of American
civilization lived in a certain Crescent land in the Atlantic that a physical catastrophe
destroyed their country whereupon the remnant that was saved commemorated their lost land
by adopting the moon as their god.&nbsp;<a href="#note233"><u>[233]</u></a> "The
population of Central America," says the Vicomte de Bussierre, "although they had
preserved the vague notion of a superior eternal God and Creator, known by the name
Teotl, had an Olympus as numerous as that of the Greeks and the Romans. It would appear
that the inhabitants of Anahuac joined to the idea of a supreme being the worship of the
sun and the moon, offering them flowers, fruits, and the first fruits of their
fields."&nbsp;<a href="#note234"><u>[234]</u></a> Dr. Reville bids us "note that the
ancient Central-American cultus of the sun and moon, considered as the two supreme
deities, was by no means renounced by the Aztecs."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note235"><u>[235]</u></a> Regarding this remarkable race, a writer in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> for April, 1883, says: "Even the Chaldaeans were not greater astrologers than
the Aztecs, and we need no further proof that the heavenly bodies were closely and
accurately observed, than we find in the fact that the true length of the tropical year
had been ascertained long before scientific instruments were even thought of. Their
religious festivals were regulated by the movements of these bodies; but with their
knowledge was mingled so vast a mass of superstition, that it is difficult to discern a
gleam of light through the thick darkness." "The Botocudos of Brazil held the moon in
high veneration, and attributed to her influence the chief phenomena in
nature."&nbsp;<a href="#note236"><u>[236]</u></a> The Indian of the Coroados tribe in
Brazil, "chained to the present, hardly ever raises his eyes to the starry firmament. Yet
he is actuated by a certain awe of some constellations, as of everything that indicates a
spiritual connection of things. His chief attention, however, is not directed to the sun,
but to the moon; according to which he calculates time, and from which he is used to
deduce good and evil."&nbsp;<a href="#note237"><u>[237]</u></a></p>

<p>The celebrated Abipones honour with silver altars and adoration the moon, which they
call the consort of the sun, and certain stars, which they term the handmaids of the
moon: but their most singular idea is that the Pleiades represent their grandfather; and
"as that constellation disappears at certain periods from the sky of South America, upon
such occasions they suppose that their grandfather is sick, and are under a yearly
apprehension that he is going to die; but as soon as those seven stars are again visible
in the month of May, they welcome their grandfather, as if returned and restored from
sickness, with joyful shouts, and the festive sound of pipes and trumpets, congratulating
him on the recovery of his health."&nbsp;<a href="#note238"><u>[238]</u></a></p>

<p>The Peruvians "acknowledge no other gods than the Pachacamac, who is the supreme, and
the Sun, who is inferior to him, and the Moon, who is his sister and wife."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note239"><u>[239]</u></a> In the religion of the Incas the idol (huaco) of the Moon was
in charge of women, and when it was brought from the house of the Sun, to be worshipped,
it was carried on their shoulders, because they said "it was a woman, and the figure
resembled one." &nbsp;<a href="#note240"><u>[240]</u></a><i>Pachacamac</i>, the great
deity mentioned above, signifies "earth-animator."</p>

<p>Prescott, in describing the temple of the Sun, at Cuzco in Peru, tells us that
"adjoining the principal structure were several chapels of smaller dimensions. One of
them was consecrated to the Moon, the deity held next in reverence, as the mother of the
Incas. Her effigy was delineated in the same manner as that of the Sun, on a vast plate
that nearly covered one side of the apartment. But this plate, as well as all the
decorations of the building, was of silver, as suited to the pale, silvery light of the
beautiful planet."&nbsp;<a href="#note241"><u>[241]</u></a></p>

<p>In the far-off New Hebrides the Eramangans "worship the moon, having images in the
form of the new and full moons, made of a kind of stone. They do not pray to these
images, but cleave to them as their protecting gods."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note242"><u>[242]</u></a></p>

<p>We have now circumnavigated the globe, touching at many points, within many degrees of
latitude and longitude. But everywhere, among men of different literatures and languages,
colours and creeds, we have discovered the worship of the moon. No nation has outgrown
the practice, for it obtains among the polished as well as the rude. One thing, indeed,
we ought to have had impressed upon our minds with fresh force; namely, that we often
draw the lines of demarcation too broad between those whom we are pleased to divide into
the civilized and the savage. Israelite and heathen, Grecian and barbarian, Roman and
pagan, enlightened and benighted, saintly and sinful, are fine distinctions from the
Hebrew, Greek, Roman, enlightened, and saintly sides of the question; but they often
reflect small credit upon the wisdom and generosity of their authors. The antipodal
Eramangan who cleaves to his moon image for protection may be quite equal, both
intellectually and morally, with the Anglo-Saxon who still wears his amulet to ward off
disease, or nails up his horse-shoe, as Nelson did to the mast of the <i>Victory</i>, as
a guarantee of good luck. Sir George Grey has written: "It must be borne in mind, that
the native races, who believed in these traditions or superstitions, are in no way
deficient in intellect, and in no respect incapable of receiving the truths of
Christianity; on the contrary, they readily embrace its doctrines and submit to its
rules; in our schools they stand a fair comparison with Europeans; and, when instructed
in Christian truths, blush at their own former ignorance and superstitions, and look back
with shame and loathing upon their previous state of wickedness and
credulity."&nbsp;<a href="#note243"><u>[243]</u></a></p><br>
<a name="II4" id="II4"></a>IV. THE MOON A WATER-DEITY.

<p>We design this chapter to be the completion of moon-worship, and at the same time an
anticipation of those lunary superstitions which are but scattered leaves from
luniolatry, the parent tree. If the new moon, with its waxing light, may represent the
primitive nature-worship which spread over the earth; and the full moon, the deity who is
supposed to regulate our reservoirs and supplies of water: the waning moon may fitly
typify the grotesque and sickly superstition, which, under the progress of radiant
science and spiritual religion, is readier every hour to vanish away.</p>

<p>"The name Astarte was variously identified with the moon, as distinguished from the
sun, or with air and water, as opposed in their qualities to fire. The name of this
goddess represented to the worshipper the great female parent of all animated things,
variously conceived of as the moon, the earth, the watery element, primeval night, the
eldest of the destinies."&nbsp;<a href="#note244"><u>[244]</u></a> It is worthy of note
that Van Helmont, in the seventeenth century, holds similar language. His words are, "The
moon is chief over the night darkness, rest, death, and the waters."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note245"><u>[245]</u></a> It is also remarkable that in the language of the Algonquins
of North America the ideas of night, death, cold, sleep, water, and moon are expressed by
one and the same word.&nbsp;<a href="#note246"><u>[246]</u></a> In the oriental mythology
"the connection between the moon and water suggests the idea that the moon produces
fertility and freshness in the soil."&nbsp;<a href="#note247"><u>[247]</u></a> "Al
Zamakhshari, the commentator on the Koran, derives <i>Manah</i> (one of the three idols
worshipped by the Arabs before the time of Mohammad) from the root 'to flow,' because of
the blood which flowed at the sacrifices to this idol, or, as Millius explains it,
because the ancient idea of the moon was that it was a star full of moisture, with which
it filled the sublunary regions."&nbsp;<a href="#note248"><u>[248]</u></a> The Persians
held that the moon was the cause of an abundant supply of water and of rain, and
therefore the names of the most fruitful places in Persia are compounded with the word
<i>m&acirc;h</i>, "moon"; "for in the opinion of the Iranians the growth of plants
depends on the influence of the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note249"><u>[249]</u></a> In India
"the moon is generally a male, for its most popular names, <i>Candras</i>, <i>Indus</i>,
and <i>Somas</i>, are masculine; but as Somas signifies ambrosia, the moon, as giver of
ambrosia, soon came to be considered a milk-giving cow; in fact, moon is one among the
various meanings given in Sanskrit to the word G&acirc;us (cow). The moon, Somas, who
illumines the nocturnal sky, and the pluvial sun, Indras, who during the night, or the
winter, prepares the light of morn, or spring, are represented as companions; a young
girl, the evening, or autumnal twilight, who goes to draw water towards night, or winter,
finds in the well, and takes to Indras, the ambrosial moon, that is, the Somas whom he
loves. Here are the very words of the Vedic hymn: 'The young girl, descending towards the
water, found the moon in the fountain, and said: I will take you to Indras, I will take
you to &Ccedil;akras; flow, O moon, and envelop Indras.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note250"><u>[250]</u></a> Here in India we again find our old friend "the frog in the
moon." "It is especially Indus who satisfies the frog's desire for rain. Indus, as the
moon, brings or announces the Somas, or the rain; the frog, croaking, announces or brings
the rain; and at this point the frog, which we have seen identified at first with the
cloud, is also identified with the pluvial moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note251"><u>[251]</u></a> This myth is not lacking in involution.</p>

<p>In China "the moon is regarded as chief and director of everything subject in the
kosmic system to the Yin [feminine] principle, such as darkness, the earth, female
creatures, water, etc. Thus Pao P'ah Tsze declares with reference to the tides: 'The
vital essence of the moon governs water: and hence, when the moon is at its brightest,
the tides are high.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note252"><u>[252]</u></a> According to the Japanese
fairy tale the moon was to "rule over the new-born earth and the blue waste of the sea,
with its multitudinous salt waters."&nbsp;<a href="#note253"><u>[253]</u></a> Thus we see
that throughout Asia, "as lord of moisture and humidity, the moon is connected with
growth and the nurturing power of the peaceful night."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note254"><u>[254]</u></a></p>

<p>Of the kindred of the Pharaohs, Plutarch observes: "The sun and moon were described by
the Egyptians as sailing round the world in boats, intimating that these bodies owe their
power of moving, as well as their support and nourishment, to the principle of humidity"
(Plut. de Isid. s. 34): which statement Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson says is confirmed by the
sculptures. The moon-god Khons bears in his hands either a palm-branch or "the
Nilometer." When the Egyptians sacrificed a pig to the moon, "the first sacred emblem
they carried was a <i>hydria</i>, or water-pitcher." At another festival the Egyptians
"marched in procession towards the sea-side, whither likewise the priests and other
proper officers carried the sacred chest, inclosing a small boat or vessel of gold, into
which they first poured some fresh water; and then all present cried out with a loud
voice 'Osiris is found.' This ceremony being ended, they threw a little fresh mould,
together with rich odours and spices, into the water, mixing the whole mass together, and
working it up into a little image in the shape of a crescent. The image was afterwards
dressed and adorned with a proper habit, and the whole was intended to intimate that they
looked upon these gods as the essence and power of earth and water."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note255"><u>[255]</u></a></p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarians have a man in the moon who is a sort of aquarius. Grimm says:
"Water, an essential part of the Norse myth, is wanting in the story of the man with the
thorn bush, but it reappears in the Carniolan story cited in Bretano's Libussa (p. 421):
the man in the moon is called Kotar, he makes her grow by pouring water."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note256"><u>[256]</u></a> The Scandinavian legend, distilled into Jack and Jill, is, as
we have seen, an embodiment of early European belief that the ebb and flow of the tides
were dependent upon the motions and mutations of the moon.</p>

<p>We find the same notion prevailing in the western hemisphere. "As the MOON is
associated with the dampness and dews of night, an ancient and widespread myth identified
her with the goddess of water. Moreover, in spite of the expostulations of the learned,
the common people the world over persist in attributing to her a marked influence on the
rains. Whether false or true, this familiar opinion is of great antiquity, and was
decidedly approved by the Indians, who were all, in the words of an old author, 'great
observers of the weather by the moon.' They looked upon her, not only as forewarning them
by her appearance of the approach of rains and fogs, but as being their actual cause.
Isis, her Egyptian title, literally means moisture; Ataensic, whom the Hurons said was
the moon, is derived from the word for water; and Citatli and Atl, moon and water, are
constantly confounded in Aztec theology."&nbsp;<a href="#note257"><u>[257]</u></a> One of
the gods of the Dakotahs was "Unk-ta-he (god of the water). The Dakotahs say that this
god and its associates are seen in their dreams. It is the master-spirit of all their
juggling and superstitious belief, From it the medicine men obtain their supernatural
powers, and a great part of their religion springs from this god."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note258"><u>[258]</u></a> Brinton also says of this large Indian nation, "that Muktahe,
spirit of water, is the master of dreams and witchcraft, is the belief of the
Dakotahs."&nbsp;<a href="#note259"><u>[259]</u></a> We know that the Dakotahs worshipped
the moon, and therefore see no difficulty in identifying that divinity with their god of
dreams and water. "In the legend of the Muyscas it is Chia, the moon, who was also
goddess of water and flooded the earth out of spite."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note260"><u>[260]</u></a> In this myth the moon is a malevolent deity, and water,
usually a symbol of life, becomes an agency of death. Reactions are constantly occurring
in the myth-making process. The god is male or female, good or evil, angry or amiable,
according to the season or climate, the aspect of nature or the mood of the people. "In
hot countries," says Sir John Lubbock, "the sun is generally regarded as an evil, and in
cold as a beneficent being."&nbsp;<a href="#note261"><u>[261]</u></a> We are willing to
accept this, with allowance. There is little question that taking men as a whole they are
mainly optimistic in their judgments respecting the gifts of earth and the glories of
heaven. Mr. Brinton, in reference to the imagined destructiveness of the water deity,
writes: "Another reaction in the mythological laboratory is here disclosed. As the good
qualities of water were attributed to the goddess of night, sleep, and death, so her
malevolent traits were in turn reflected back on this element. Taking, however, American
religions as a whole, water is far more frequently represented as producing beneficent
effects than the reverse."&nbsp;<a href="#note262"><u>[262]</u></a></p>

<p>"The time of full moon was chosen both in Mexico and Peru to celebrate the festival of
the deities of water, the patrons of agriculture, and very generally the ceremonies
connected with the crops were regulated by her phases. The Nicaraguans said that the god
of rains, Quiateot, rose in the east, thus hinting how this connection
originated."&nbsp;<a href="#note263"><u>[263]</u></a> "The Muyscas of the high plains of
Bogota were once, they said, savages without agriculture, religion, or law; but there
came to them from the east an old and bearded man, Bochica, the child of the sun, and he
taught them to till the fields, to clothe themselves, to worship the gods, to become a
nation. But Bochica had a wicked, beautiful wife, Huythaca, who loved to spite and spoil
her husband's work; and she it was who made the river swell till the land was covered by
a flood, and but a few of mankind escaped upon the mountain tops. Then Bochica was wroth,
and he drove the wicked Huythaca from the earth, and made her the moon, for there had
been no moon before; and he cleft the rocks and made the mighty cataract of Tequendama,
to let the deluge flow away. Then, when the land was dry, he gave to the remnant of
mankind the year and its periodic sacrifices, and the worship of the sun. Now the people
who told this myth had not forgotten, what indeed we might guess without their help, that
Bochica was himself Zuh&eacute;, the sun, and Huytheca, the sun's wife, the
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note264"><u>[264]</u></a> This interesting and instructive legend,
to which we alluded before in a brief quotation from Mr. Brinton, is worthy of
reproduction in its fuller form, and fitly concludes our moon mythology and worship, as
it presents a synoptical view of the chief points to which our attention has been turned.
It shows us primitive or primeval man, the dawn of civilization, the daybreak of
religion, the upgrowth of national life. In its solar husband and lunar wife it embraces
that anthropomorphism and sexuality which we think have been and still are the principal
factors in the production of legendary and religious impersonations. It includes that
dualism which is one of man's oldest attempts to account for the opposition of good and
evil. And finally it predicts a new humanity, springing from a remnant of the old; and a
progress of brighter years, when, the deluge having disappeared, the dry land shall be
fruitful in every good; when men shall worship the Father of lights, and "God shall be
all in all."</p>

<a name="III" id="III"></a>MOON SUPERSTITIONS.
</center><br>
<a name="III1" id="III1"></a>I. INTRODUCTION.<br>

<p>Superstition may be defined as an extravagance of faith and fear: not what
Ecclesiastes calls being "righteous overmuch," but religious reverence in excess. Some
etymologists say that the word originally meant a "<i>standing</i> still <i>over</i> or
by a thing" in fear, wonder, or dread.&nbsp;<a href="#note265"><u>[265]</u></a> Brewer's
definition is rather more classical: "That which survives when its companions are dead
(Latin, <i>supersto</i>). Those who escaped in battle were called
<i>superstit&euml;s</i>. Superstition is that religion which remains when real religion
is dead; that fear and awe and worship paid to the religious impression which survives in
the mind when correct notions of Deity no longer exist."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note266"><u>[266]</u></a> Hooker says that superstition "is always joined with a wrong
opinion touching things divine. Superstition is, when things are either abhorred or
observed with a zealous or fearful, but erroneous relation to God. By means whereof the
superstitious do sometimes serve, though the true God, yet with needless offices, and
defraud Him of duties necessary; sometimes load others than Him with such honours as
properly are His."&nbsp;<a href="#note267"><u>[267]</u></a> A Bampton Lecturer on this
subject says: "Superstition is an <i>unreasonable belief</i> of that which is mistaken
for truth concerning the nature of God and the invisible world, our relations to these
unseen objects, and the duties which spring out of those relations."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note268"><u>[268]</u></a></p>

<p>We may next briefly inquire into the origin of the thing, which, of course, is older
than the word. Burton will help us to an easy answer. He tells us that "the <i>primum
mobile</i>, and first mover of all superstition, is the devil, that great enemy of
mankind, the principal agent, who in a thousand several shapes, after divers fashions,
with several engines, illusions, and by several names, hath deceived the inhabitants of
the earth, in several places and countries, still rejoicing at their
falls."&nbsp;<a href="#note269"><u>[269]</u></a> Verily this protean, omnipresent, and
malignant devil has proved himself a great convenience! He has been the scapegoat upon
whom we have laid the responsibility of all our mortal woe: and now we learn that to his
infernal influence we are indebted for our ignorance and superstition. Henceforth, when
we are at our wit's end, we may apostrophize the difficulty, and exclaim, "O thou
invisible spirit, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!" We
hesitate to spoil this serviceable illusion: for as we have known some good people, of a
sort, who would be distressed to find that there was no hell to burn up the opponents of
their orthodoxy; we fear lest many would be disappointed if they found out that the
infernal spirit was not at the bottom of our abysmal ignorance. But we will give even the
devil his due. We are not like Sir William Brown, who "could never bring himself heartily
to hate the devil." We can, wherever we find him; but we think it only honest to father
our own mental deficiencies, as well as our moral delinquencies, and instead of seeking a
substitute to use the available remedy. "To err is human"; and it is in humanity itself
that we shall discover the source of superstition. We are the descendants of ancestors
who were the children of the world, and we were ourselves children not so long ago.
Childhood is the age of fancy and fiction; of sensitiveness to outer influences; of
impressions of things as they seem, not as they are. When we become men we put away
childish things; and in the manhood of our race we shall banish many of the idols and
ideas which please us while we grow. Darwin has told us that our "judgment will not
rarely err from ignorance and weak powers of reasoning. Hence the strangest customs and
superstitions, in complete opposition to the true welfare and happiness of mankind, have
become all-powerful throughout the world. How so many absurd rules of conduct, as well as
so many absurd religious beliefs, have originated, we do not know; nor how it is that
they have become, in all quarters of the world, so deeply impressed on the mind of men;
but it is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of
life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an
instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of
reason."&nbsp;<a href="#note270"><u>[270]</u></a></p>

<p>But if superstition be the result of imperfection, there is no gainsaying the fact
that it is productive of infinite evil; and on this account it has been attributed to a
diabolical paternity. Bacon even affirms that "it were better to have no opinion of God
at all, than such an opinion as is unworthy of Him; for the one is unbelief, the other is
contumely: and certainly superstition is the reproach of the Deity."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note271"><u>[271]</u></a> Most heartily do we hold with Dr. Thomas Browne: "It is not
enough to believe in God as an irresistible power that presides over the universe; for
this a malignant demon might be. It is necessary for our devout happiness that we should
believe in Him as that pure and gracious Being who is the encourager of our virtues and
the comforter of our sorrows.</p>

<blockquote>
Quantum religio potuit suadere malorum,
</blockquote>

<p>exclaims the Epicurean poet, in thinking of the evils which superstition,
characterized by that ambiguous name, had produced; and where a fierce or gloomy
superstition has usurped the influence which religion graciously exercises only for
purposes of benevolence to man, whom she makes happy with a present enjoyment, by the
very expression of devout gratitude for happiness already enjoyed, it would not be easy
to estimate the amount of positive misery which must result from the mere contemplation
of a tyrant in the heavens, and of a creation subject to his cruelty and
caprice."&nbsp;<a href="#note272"><u>[272]</u></a> The above quoted line from
Lucretius--To such evils could religion persuade!--is more than the exclamation
of righteous indignation against the sacrifice of Iphigenia by her father, Agamemnon, at
the bidding of a priest, to propitiate a goddess. It is still further applicable to the
long chain of outrageous wrongs which have been inflicted upon the innocent at the
instigation of a stupid and savage fanaticism. What is worst of all, much of this
bloodthirsty religion has claimed a commission from the God of love, and performed its
detestable deeds in the insulted name of that "soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil
spirit," whom the loftiest and best of men delight to adore as the Prince of peace. No
wonder that Voltaire cried out, "Christian religion, behold thy consequences!" if he
could calculate that ten million lives had been immolated on the altar of a spurious
Christianity. One hundred thousand were slain in the Bartholomew massacre alone.
Righteousness, peace, and love were not the monster which Voltaire laboured to crush: he
was most intensely incensed against the blind and bigoted priesthood, against the
malicious and murderous servants who ate the bread of a holy and harmless Master, against
"their intolerance of light and hatred of knowledge, their fierce yet profoundly
contemptible struggles with one another, the scandals of their casuistry, their besotted
cruelty."&nbsp;<a href="#note273"><u>[273]</u></a> We have been betrayed into speaking
thus strongly of the extreme lengths to which superstition will carry those who yield
themselves to its ruthless tyranny. But perhaps we have not gone far from our subject,
after all; for the innocent Iphigenia, whose doom kindled our ire, was sacrificed to the
goddess of the moon.</p><br>
<a name="III2" id="III2"></a>II. LUNAR FANCIES.

<p>There are a few phosphorescent fancies about the moon, like <i>ignes fatui</i>,</p>

<blockquote>
"Dancing in murky night o'er fen and lake,"
</blockquote>

<p>which we may dispose of in a section by themselves. Those of them that are mythical
are too evanescent to become full-grown myths; and those which are religious are too
volatile to remain in the solution or salt of any bottled creed. Like the wandering
lights of the Russians, answering to our will-o'-the-wisp, they are the souls of
still-born children. There is, for example, the insubstantial and formless but pleasing
conception of the Indian Veda. In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yanam the moon is a good fairy, who
in giving light in the night assumes a benignant aspect and succours the dawn. In the
Vedic hymn, R&acirc;k&acirc;, the full moon, is exhorted to sew the work with a needle
which cannot be broken. Here the moon is personified as preparing during the night her
luminous garments, one for the evening, the other for the morning, the one lunar and of
silver, the other solar and of gold.&nbsp;<a href="#note274"><u>[274]</u></a> Another
notion, equally airy but more religious, has sprung up in Christian times and in Catholic
countries. It is that heathen fancy which connects the moon with the Virgin Mary.
Abundant evidence of this association in the minds of Roman Catholics is furnished by the
style of the ornaments which crowd the continental churches. One of the most conspicuous
is the sun and moon in conjunction, precisely as they are represented on Babylonian and
Grecian coins; and the identification of the Virgin and her Child with the moon any Roman
Catholic cathedral will show.&nbsp;<a href="#note275"><u>[275]</u></a> The <i>Roman
Missal</i> will present to any reader "Sancta Maria, coeli Regina, et mundi Domina"; the
<i>Glories of Mary</i> will exhibit her as the omnipotent mother, Queen of the Universe;
and Ecclesiastical History will declare how, as early as the close of the fourth century,
the women who were called Collyridians worshipped her "as a goddess, and judged it
necessary to appease her anger, and seek her favour and protection, by libations,
sacrifices, and oblations of cakes (<i>collyridae</i>)."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note276"><u>[276]</u></a> This is but a repetition of the women kneading dough to make
cakes to the queen of heaven, as recorded by Jeremiah; and proves that the relative
position occupied by Astarte in company with Baal, Juno with Jupiter, Doorga with Brahma,
and Ma-tsoo-po with Boodh, is that occupied by Mary with God. Nay more, she is "Mater
Creatoris" and "Dei Genetrix": Mother of the Creator, Mother of God. Having thus been
enthroned in the position in the universal pantheon which was once occupied by the moon,
what wonder that the ignorant devotee should see her in that orb, especially as the sun,
moon, and stars of the Apocalypse are her chief symbols. Southey has recorded a good
illustration of this superstitious fancy. "A fine circumstance occurred in the shipwreck
of the <i>Santiago</i>, 1585. The ship struck in the night; the wretched crew had been
confessing, singing litanies, etc., and this they continued till, about two hours before
break of day, the moon arose beautiful and exceeding bright; and forasmuch as till that
time they had been in such darkness that they could scarcely sec one another when close
at hand, such was the stir among them at beholding the brightness and glory of that orb,
that most part of the crew began to lift up their voices, and with tears, cries, and
groans called upon Our Lady, saying they saw her in the moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note277"><u>[277]</u></a></p>

<p>The preceding fancies would produce upon the poetic and religious sense only an
agreeable effect. Other hallucinations have wrought effects of an opposite kind. The face
in the moon does not always wear an amiable aspect, and it is not unnatural that those
who have been taught to believe in angry gods and frowning providences should see the
caricatures of their false teachers reproduced in the heavens above and in the earth
beneath. We are reminded here of the magic mirror mentioned by Bayle. There is a trick,
invented by Pythagoras, which is performed in the following manner. The moon being at the
full, some one writes with blood on a looking-glass anything he has a mind to; and having
given notice of it to another person, he stands behind that other and turns towards the
moon the letters written in the glass. The other looking fixedly on the shining orb reads
in it all that is written on the mirror as if it were written on the moon.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note278"><u>[278]</u></a> This is precisely the <i>modus operandi</i> by which the
knavish have imposed upon the foolish in all ages. The manipulator of the doctrine stands
behind his credulous disciple, writing out of sight his invented science or theology, and
writing too often with the blood of some innocent victim. The poor patient student is
meanwhile gazing on the moon in dreamy devotion; until as the writing on the mirror is
read with solemn intonation, it all appears before his moon-struck gaze as a heavenly
revelation. Woe to the truth-loving critic who breaks the enchantment and the mirror,
crying out in the vernacular tongue, Your mysteries are myths, your writings are frauds;
and the fair moon is innocent of the lying imposition!</p>

<p>To multitudes the moon has always been an object of terror and dread. Not only is it a
supramundane and magnified man--that it will always be while its spots are so
anthropoid, and man himself is so anthropomorphic--but it has ever been, and still
is, a being of maleficent and misanthropic disposition. As Mr. Tylor says, "When the
Aleutians thought that if any one gave offence to the moon, he would fling down stones on
the offender and kill him; or when the moon came down to an Indian squaw, appearing in
the form of a beautiful woman with a child in her arms, and demanding an offering of
tobacco and fur-robes: what conceptions of personal life could be more distinct than
these?"&nbsp;<a href="#note279"><u>[279]</u></a> Personal and distinct, indeed, but far
from pleasant. Another author tells us that "in some parts of Scotland to point at the
stars or to do aught that might be considered an indignity in the face of the sun or
moon, is still to be dreaded and avoided; so also it was not long since, probably still
is, in Devonshire and Cornwall. The Jews seem to have been equally superstitious on this
point (Jer. viii. 1, 2), and the Persians believed leprosy to be an infliction on those
who had committed some offence against the sun."&nbsp;<a href="#note280"><u>[280]</u></a>
Southey supplies us with an illustration of the moon in a fit of dudgeon. He is
describing the sufferings of poor Hans Stade, when he was caught by the Tupinambas and
expected that he was about to die. "The moon was up, and fixing his eyes upon her, he
silently besought God to vouchsafe him a happy termination of these sufferings. Yeppipo
Wasu, who was one of the chiefs of the horde, and as such had convoked the meeting,
seeing how earnestly he kept gazing upwards, asked him what he was looking at. Hans had
ceased from praying, and was observing the man in the moon, and fancying that he looked
angry; his mind was broken down by continual terror, and he says it seemed to him at that
moment as if he were hated by God, and by all things which God had created. The question
only half roused him from this phantasy, and he answered, it was plain that the moon was
angry. The savage asked whom she was angry with, and then Hans, as if he had recollected
himself, replied that she was looking at his dwelling. This enraged him, and Hans found
it prudent to say that perhaps her eyes were turned so wrathfully upon the Carios; in
which opinion the chief assented, and wished she might destroy them all."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note281"><u>[281]</u></a> Some such superstitious fear must have furnished the
warp into which the following Icelandic story was woven. &quot;There was once a
sheep-stealer who sat down in a lonely place, with a leg of mutton in his hand,
in order to feast upon it, for he had just stolen it. The moon shone bright and
clear, not a single cloud being there in heaven to hide her. While enjoying his
gay feast, the impudent thief cut a piece off the meat, and, putting it on the
point of his knife, accosted the moon with these godless words:--</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O moon, wilt thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy mouth now<br>
This dainty bit of mutton-meat?'
</blockquote>

<p>Then a voice came from the heavens, saying:--</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wouldst thou, thief, like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cheek to strike<br>
This fair key, scorching-red with heat?'
</blockquote>

<p>At the same moment, a red-hot key fell from the sky on to the cheek of the thief,
burning on it a mark which he carried with him ever afterwards. Hence arose the custom in
ancient times of branding or marking thieves."&nbsp;<a href="#note282"><u>[282]</u></a>
The moral influence of this tale is excellent, and has the cordial admiration of all who
hate robbery and effrontery: at the same time it exhibits the moon as an irascible body,
with which no liberty may be taken. In short, it is an object of superstitious awe.</p>

<p>One other lunar fancy, born and bred in fear, is connected with the abominable
superstition of witchcraft. Abominable, unquestionably, the evil was; but justice compels
us to add that the remedy of relentless and ruthless persecution with which it was sought
to remove the pest was a reign of abhorrent and atrocious cruelty. Into the question
itself we dare not enter, lest we should be ourselves bewitched. We know that divination
by supposed supernatural agency existed among the Hebrews, that magical incantations were
practised among the Greeks and Romans, and that more modern witchcraft has been
contemporaneous with the progress of Christianity. But we must dismiss the subject in one
borrowed sentence. "The main source from which we derived this superstition is the East,
and traditions and facts incorporated in our religion. There were only wanted the ferment
of thought of the fifteenth century, the energy, ignorance, enthusiasm, and faith of
those days, and the papal denunciation of witchcraft by the bull of Innocent the Eighth,
in 1459, to give fury to the delusion. And from this time, for three centuries, the
flames at which more than a hundred thousand victims perished cast a lurid light over
Europe."&nbsp;<a href="#note283"><u>[283]</u></a> The singular notion, which we wish to
present, is the ancient belief that witches could control the moon. In the <i>Clouds</i>
of Aristophanes, Strepsiades tells Socrates that he has &quot;a notion calculated to
deprive of interest&quot;; which is as follows:--</p>

<p>"<i>Str</i>. If I were to buy a Thessalian witch, and draw down the moon by night,
then shut her up in a round helmet-case, like a mirror, and then keep watching
her--&quot;</p>

<p>"<i>Soc</i>. What good would that do you, then?"</p>

<p>"<i>Str</i>. What? If the moon were not to rise any more anywhere, I should not pay
the interest."</p>

<p>"<i>Soc</i>. Because what?"</p>

<p>"<i>Str</i>. Because the money is lent by the month."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note284"><u>[284]</u></a></p>

<p>Shakespeare alludes to this, where Prospero says, "His mother was a witch, and one so
strong that could control the moon" (<i>Tempest</i>, Act v.).</p>

<p>If the witch's broom, on whose stick she rode to the moon, be a type of the wind, we
may guess how the fancy grew up that the airy creation could control those atmospheric
vapours on which the light and humidity of the night were supposed to
depend.&nbsp;<a href="#note285"><u>[285]</u></a></p><br>
<a name="III3" id="III3"></a>III. LUNAR ECLIPSES.

<p>All round the globe, from time immemorial, those periodic phenomena known as solar and
lunar eclipses have been occasions of mental disquietude and superstitious alarm. Though
now regarded as perfectly natural and regular, they have seemed so preternatural and
irregular to the unscientific eye that we cannot wonder at the consternation which they
have caused. And it must be confessed that a total obscuration of the sun in the middle
of the day casts such a gloom over the earth that men not usually timid are still
excusable if during the parenthesis they feel a temporary uneasiness, and are relieved
when the ruler of the day emerges from his dark chamber, apparently rejoicing to renew
his race. An eclipse of the moon, though less awe-inspiring, is nevertheless sufficiently
so to awaken in the superstitious brain fearful forebodings of impending calamity.
Science may demonstrate that there is nothing abnormal in these occurrences, but to the
seeker after signs it wilt be throwing words away; for, as Lord Kames says,
"Superstitious eyes are never opened by instruction."</p>

<p>We will now produce a number of testimonies to show how these lunar eclipses have been
viewed among the various races of the earth in ancient and modern times. The Chaldaeans
were careful observers of eclipses, and Berosus believed that when the moon was obscured
she turned to us her dark side. Anaximenes said that her mouth was stopped. Plato,
Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Mathematicians said that she fell into conjunction with
the bright sun. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (born B.C. 499) was the first to explain the
eclipse of the moon as caused by the shadow of the earth cast by the sun. But he was as
one born out of due time. We are all familiar with the use made by students of
unfulfilled prophecy of every extraordinary occurrence in nature, such as the sudden
appearance of a comet, an earthquake, an eclipse, etc. We know how mysteriously they
interpret those simple passages in the Bible about the sun being darkened and the moon
being turned into blood. If they were not wilfully blind, such facts as are established
by the following quotations would open their eyes to the errors in their exegesis. At any
rate, they would find their theories anticipated in nearly every particular by those very
heathen whom they are wont to pity as so benighted and hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>Grimm writes: "One of the most terrible phenomena to heathens was an <i>eclipse</i> of
the sun or moon, which they associated with a destruction of all things and the end of
the world. I may safely assume that the same superstitious notions and practices attend
eclipses among nations ancient and modern. The Indian belief is that a serpent eats up
the sun and moon when they arc eclipsed, or a demon devours them. To this day the Hindoos
consider that a giant lays hold of the luminaries and tries to swallow them. The Chinese
call the solar eclipse zhishi (solis devoratio), the lunar yueshi (lunae devoratio), and
ascribe them both to the machinations of a dragon. Nearly all the populations of Northern
Asia hold the same opinion. The Finns of Europe, the Lithuanians, and the Moors in
Africa, have a similar belief."&nbsp;<a href="#note286"><u>[286]</u></a> Flammarion says:
"Among the ancient nations people used to come to the assistance of the moon, by making a
confused noise with all kinds of instruments, when it was eclipsed. It is even done now
in Persia and some parts of China, where they fancy that the moon is fighting with a
great dragon, and they think the noise will make him loose his hold and take to flight.
Among the East Indians they have the same belief that when the sun and the moon are
eclipsed, a dragon is seizing them, and astronomers who go there to observe eclipses are
troubled by the fears of their native attendants, and by their endeavours to get into the
water as the best place under the circumstances. In America the idea is that the sun and
moon are tired when they are eclipsed. But the more refined Greeks believed for a long
time that the moon was bewitched, and that the magicians made it descend from heaven to
put into the herbs a certain maleficent froth. Perhaps the idea of the dragon arose from
the ancient custom of calling the places in the heavens at which the eclipses of the moon
took place the head and tail of the dragon."&nbsp;<a href="#note287"><u>[287]</u></a> Sir
Edward Sherburne, in his "Annotations upon the <i>Medea</i>," quaintly says: "Of the
beating of kettles, basons, and other brazen vessels used by the ancients when the moone
was eclipsed (which they did to drown the charms of witches, that the moon might not hear
them, and so be drawne from her spheare as they suppos'd), I shall not need to speake,
being a thing so generally knowne, a custom continued among the Turks to this day; yet I
cannot but adde, and wonder at, what Joseph Scaliger, in his 'Annotations upon Manilius,'
reports out of Bonincontrius, an ancient commentator upon the same poet, who affirms that
in a town of Italy where he lived (within these two centuries of yeares), he saw the same
piece of paganisme acted upon the like occasion."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note288"><u>[288]</u></a> Another, and more recent writer, also says of these eclipses:
"The Chinese imagine them to be caused by great dragons trying to devour the sun and
moon, and beat drums and brass kettles to make the monsters give up their prey. Some of
the tribes of American Indians speak of the moon as hunted by huge dogs, catching and
tearing her till her soft light is reddened and put out by the blood flowing from her
wounds. To this day in India the native beats his gong, as the moon passes across the
sun's face, and it is not so very long ago that in Europe both eclipses and rushing
comets were thought to show that troubles were near."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note289"><u>[289]</u></a> Respecting China, a modern traveller speaks in not very
complimentary language. "If there is on the earth a nation absorbed by the affairs of
this world and who trouble themselves little about what passes among the heavenly bodies,
it is assuredly the Chinese. The most erudite among them just know of the existence of
astronomy, or, as they call it, <i>tienwen</i>--'celestial literature.' But they are
ignorant of the simplest principles of the science, and those who regard an eclipse as a
natural phenomenon, instead of a dragon who is seeking to devour the sun and moon, are
enlightened indeed."&nbsp;<a href="#note290"><u>[290]</u></a> This statement ought to be
taken with more than one <i>granum salis</i>, especially as Mrs. Somerville assures us
that the Chinese had made advances in the science of astronomy 1,100 years before the
Christian era, and also adds: "Their whole chronology is founded on the observation of
eclipses, which prove the existence of that empire for more than 4,700
years."&nbsp;<a href="#note291"><u>[291]</u></a> With this discount the charge against
Chinese ignorance may be passed. "A Mongolian myth makes out that the gods determined to
punish Arakho for his misdeeds, but he hid so effectually that no one could find out his
lurking-place. They therefore asked the <i>sun</i>, who gave an unsatisfactory answer;
but when they asked the <i>moon</i>, she disclosed his whereabouts. So Arakho was dragged
forth and chastised; in revenge of which he <i>pursues both sun and moon</i>, and
whenever he comes to hand-grips with one of them, <i>an eclipse occurs</i>. To help the
lights of heaven in their sad plight, a <i>tremendous uproar</i> is made with musical and
other instruments, till Arakho is scared away."&nbsp;<a href="#note292"><u>[292]</u></a>
"Referring to the Shoo, Pt. III., Bk. IV., parag. 4, we find this sentence: 'On the first
day of the last month of autumn the sun and moon did not meet harmoniously in
Fang.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note293"><u>[293]</u></a> In less euphemistic phrase, the sun and
moon were <i>crossed</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Wells Williams describes an interesting scene. "In the middle of the sixth moon
lanterns are hung from the top of a pole placed on the highest part of the house. A
single small lantern is deemed sufficient, but if the night be calm, a greater display is
made by some householders, and especially in boats, by exhibiting coloured glass lamps
arranged in various ways. The illumination of a city like Canton, when seen from a high
spot, is made still more brilliant by the moving boats on the river. On one of these
festivals at Canton, an almost total eclipse of the moon called out the entire
population, each one carrying something with which to make a noise, kettles, pans,
sticks, drums, gongs, guns, crackers, and what not to frighten away the dragon of the sky
from his hideous feast. The advancing shadow gradually caused the myriads of lanterns to
show more and more distinctly, and started a still increasing clamour, till the darkness
and the noise were both at their climax. Silence gradually resumed its sway as the moon
recovered her fulness."&nbsp;<a href="#note294"><u>[294]</u></a> On another page Dr.
Williams tells us that "some clouds having on one occasion covered the sky, so that an
eclipse could not be seen, the courtiers joyfully repaired to the emperor to felicitate
him that Heaven, touched by his virtues, had spared him the pain of witnessing the
'eating of the sun.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note295"><u>[295]</u></a> The following passage from
Doolittle's work on the Chinese is sufficiently interesting to be given without
abridgment: "It is a part of the official duties of mandarins to 'save the sun and moon
when eclipsed.' Prospective eclipses are never noticed in the Imperial Calendar,
published originally at Peking, and republished in the provinces. The imperial
astronomers at the capital, a considerable time previous to a visible eclipse, inform the
Board of Rites of its month, day, and hour. These officers send this intelligence to the
viceroys or governors of the eighteen provinces of the empire. These, in turn,
communicate the information to all the principal subordinate officers in the provinces of
the civil and the military grade. The officers make arrangements to save the moon or the
sun at the appointed time. On the day of the eclipse, or on the day preceding it, some of
them put up a written notice in or near their yamuns, for the information of the
public.</p>

<p>"The Chinese generally have no rational idea of the cause of eclipses. The common
explanation is that the sun or the moon has experienced some disaster. Some even affirm
that the object eclipsed is being devoured by an immense ravenous monster. This is the
most popular sentiment in Fuhchau in regard to the procuring cause of eclipses. All look
upon the object eclipsed with wonder. Many are filled with apprehension and terror. Some
of the common people, as well as mandarins generally, enter upon some course of action,
the express object of which is to save the luminary from its dire calamity, or to rescue
it from the jaws of its greedy enemy. Mandarins must act officially, and in virtue of
their being officers of government. Neither they nor the people seem to regard the
immense distance of the celestial object as at all interfering with the success of their
efforts. The various obstacles which ought apparently to deter them from attempting to
save the object eclipsed do not seem to have occurred to them at all, or, if they have
occurred, do not appear to be sufficient to cause them to desist from prosecuting their
laudable endeavours. The high mandarins procure the aid of priests of the Taoist sect at
their yamuns. These place an incense censer and two large candlesticks for holding red
candles or tapers on a table in the principal reception room of the mandarin, or in the
open space in front of it under the open heavens.</p>

<p>"At the commencement of the eclipse the tapers are lighted, and soon after the
mandarin enters, dressed in his official robes. Taking some sticks of lighted incense in
both hands, he makes his obeisance before or facing the table, raising and depressing the
incense two or three times, according to the established fashion, before it is placed in
the censer. Or sometimes the incense is lighted and put in the censer by one of the
priests employed. The officer proceeds to perform the high ceremony of kneeling down
three times, and knocking his head on the ground nine times. After this he rises from his
knees. Large gongs and drums near by are now beaten as loudly as possible. The priests
begin to march slowly around the tables, reciting formulas, etc., which marching they
keep up, with more or less intermissions, until the eclipse has passed off.</p>

<p>"A uniform result always follows these official efforts to save the sun and the moon.
<i>They are invariably successful</i>. There is not a single instance recorded in the
annals of the empire when the measures prescribed in instructions from the emperor's
astronomers at Peking, and correctly carried out in the provinces by the mandarins, have
not resulted in a complete rescue of the object eclipsed. Doubtless the vast majority of
the common people in China believe that the burning of tapers and incense, the
prostration of the mandarins, the beating of the gongs and drums, and the recitations on
the part of the priests, are signally efficacious in driving away the voracious monster.
They observe that the sun or the moon does not seem to be permanently injured by the
attacks of its celestial enemy, although a half or nearly the whole appeared to have been
swallowed up. This happy result is doubtless viewed with much complacency by the parties
engaged to bring it about. The lower classes generally leave the saving of the sun or the
moon, when eclipsed, to their mandarins, as it is a part of their official business. Some
of the people occasionally beat in their houses a winnowing instrument, made of bamboo
splints, on the occasion of an eclipse. This gives out a loud noise. Some venture to
assert that the din of this instrument penetrates the clouds as high as the very temple
of Heaven itself! The sailors connected with junks at this place, on the recurrence of a
lunar eclipse, always contribute their aid to rescue the moon by beating their gongs in a
most deafening manner.</p>

<p>"Without doubt, most of the mandarins understand the real occasion of eclipses, or, at
least, they have the sense to perceive that nothing which they can do will have any
effect upon the object eclipsed, or the cause which produces the phenomenon; but they
have no optional course in regard to the matter. They must comply with established
custom, and with the understood will of their superiors. The imperial astronomers, having
been taught the principles of astronomy and the causes which produce eclipses by the
Roman Catholic missionaries a long while since, of course know that the common sentiments
on the subject are as absurd as the common customs relating to it are useless. But the
emperor and his cabinet cling to ancient practices, notwithstanding the clearest
evidences of their false and irrational character."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note296"><u>[296]</u></a></p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Giles accounts for this Chinese obtuseness, or, as some would have it,
opacity, in much the same way. Under the head of <i>Natural Phenomena</i>, he writes: "It
is a question of more than ordinary interest to those who regard the Chinese people as a
worthy object of study, What are the speculations of the working and uneducated classes
concerning such natural phenomena as it is quite impossible for them to ignore? Their
theory of eclipses is well known, foreign ears being periodically stunned by the gonging
of an excited crowd of natives, who are endeavouring with hideous noises to prevent some
imaginary dog of colossal proportions from banqueting, as the case may be, upon the sun
or moon. At such laughable exhibitions of native ignorance it will be observed there is
always a fair sprinkling of well-to-do, educated persons, who not only ought to know
better themselves, but should be making some effort to enlighten their less fortunate
countrymen instead of joining in the din. Such a hold, however, has superstition on the
minds of the best informed in a Chinese community, that under the influence of any real
or supposed danger, philosophy and Confucius are scattered to the four winds of heaven,
and the proudest disciple of the master proves himself after all but a
man."&nbsp;<a href="#note297"><u>[297]</u></a> No doubt Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Giles are
both right: custom and superstition form a twisted rope which pinions the popular mind.
But there is yet another strand to be mentioned which makes the bond a threefold cord
which it will take some time to break. <i>Prescriptive right</i> requires that the
official or cultured class in China, answering to the clerical caste elsewhere, should
keep the other classes in ignorance; because, if science and religion are fellow-helpers,
science and superstition can never dwell together, and the downfall of superstition in
China would be the destruction of imperial despotism and magisterial tyranny. "Sirs, ye
know that by this craft we have our wealth. But this Paul says that they be no gods,
which are made with hands: so that our craft is in danger to be set at nought. Great is
Diana of the Ephesians!" The mandarins know why they encourage the mechanics and
merchants to save the moon.</p>

<p>We once met a good story in reading one of Jean Astruc's medical works. "Theodore de
Henry, of Paris, coming one time into the church of St. Dionis, he fell prostrate at the
foot of the statue of Charles the Eighth, as in a sudden fit of devotion. When being told
by one of the monks that was not the image of any saint, he replied, he was not ignorant
of that, but was willing to pay a grateful acknowledgment to the memory of that prince
who had brought the <i>Morbus Gallicus</i> into France, by which he had made his own
fortune." Herein lies the secret of half of the hypocrisy of the world. Thank God! the
world moves; and the millennium of truth is at hand.</p>

<p>"<i>On an Eclipse.--A Rescript</i>. WE have heard that if a sovereign is remiss
in government, Heaven terrifies him by calamities and strange portents. These are divine
reprimands sent to recall him to a sense of duty. Thus, partial eclipses of the sun and
moon are manifest warnings that the rod of empire is not wielded aright. Ever since WE
ascended the throne, OUR inability to continue the glorious traditions of our departed
ancestors and carry on the great work of civilization, has now culminated in a warning
message from on high. It therefore behoves Us to issue commands for personal reformation,
in order to avert the impending calamity.</p>

<p>"But the relations of Heaven with Man are those of a father and son; and a father
about to chastise his son would not be deterred were the latter to present him with a
dish of meat. WE do not therefore consider it part of OUR duty to act in accordance with
certain memorials advising that the prime minister and chief astronomer be instructed to
offer up sacrifices on this occasion. Do ye, governors of districts and other high
officers of State, seek rather to rectify your own hearts; and if any one can devise
means to make up for OUR shortcomings, let him submit his proposals to the
Throne."&nbsp;<a href="#note298"><u>[298]</u></a></p>

<p>The writer of that was "not far from the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>Father Borri, in his account of Cochin China, describes the effect of a lunar eclipse
upon several scholars in the city of Nuoecman in the province of Pulucambi. "I showed
them that the circle of the moon, on that side the eclipse began, was not so perfect as
it should be, and soon after all the moon being darkened, they perceived the truth of my
prediction. The commander and all of them being astonished, presently sent to give notice
of it to all the ward, and spread the news of the eclipse throughout the city, that every
man might go out to make the usual noise in favour of the moon; giving out everywhere
that there were no such men as the fathers, whose doctrine and books could not fail being
true, since they had so exactly foretold the eclipse, which their learned men had taken
no notice of; and therefore, in performance of his promise, the commander with all his
family became Christians, as did many more of his ward, with some of the most learned men
of the city and others of note."&nbsp;<a href="#note299"><u>[299]</u></a> In no unkind
spirit we cannot refrain from noticing, what will strike every reader, how ready divines
of all denominations are to turn the teachings of science to their own account in the
propagation of their faith. It would have been seemlier for theologians in all ages, if
their attitude towards physical inquirers had been less hostile; they would then have
made converts through eclipses with a better grace. They would, moreover, have prevented
the alienation of many of their truest friends.</p>

<p>Captain Beeckman gives an amusing story of an eclipse in Cantongee, in the island of
Borneo, on the 10th of November, 1714. "We sat very merry till about eight at night,
when, preparing to go to bed, we heard all on a sudden a most terrible outcry, mixed with
squealing, halloing, whooping, firing of guns, ringing and clattering of gongs or brass
pans, that we were greatly startled, imagining nothing less but that the city was
surprised by the rebels. I ran immediately to the door, where I found my old fat landlord
roaring and whooping like a man raving mad. This increased my astonishment, and the noise
was so great that I could neither be heard, nor get an answer to know what the matter
was. At last I cried as loud as possibly I could to the old man to know the reason of
this sad confusion and outcry, who in a great fright pointed up to the heavens, and said,
'<i>Look there; see, the devil is eating up the moon</i>!' I was very glad to hear that
there was no other cause of their fright but their own ignorance. It was only a great
eclipse of the moon. I smiled, and told him that there was no danger; that in a little
while the moon would be as well as ever. Whereupon, catching fast hold of my sleeve, as I
was returning to bed, he asked me if I was sure on't (for they take us white men to be
very wise in those matters). I assured him I was, and that we always knew many years
before when such a thing would happen; that it proceeded from a natural cause, according
to the course and motion of the sun and moon, and that the devil had no hand in it. After
the eclipse was over, the old man, being not a little rejoiced, took me
in."&nbsp;<a href="#note300"><u>[300]</u></a> Another writer speaks of the East India
Islands in general. "There is to this day hardly a country of the Archipelago in which
the ceremony of frightening the supposed monster from his attack on the luminary is not
performed. This consists in shouting, in striking gongs, but, above all, in striking
their stampers against the sides of the wooden mortars which are used by the villagers in
husking their corn."&nbsp;<a href="#note301"><u>[301]</u></a> That the Indians of the
continent regard the phenomena in question with more than ordinary interest is evinced by
their resorting in large numbers to Benares, the ancient seat of brahminical learning and
religion, on every occasion of an eclipse of the moon. Lord Kames reminds us that among
the Greeks "an eclipse being held a prognostic given by the gods of some grievous
calamity, Anaxagoras was accused of atheism for attempting to explain the eclipse of the
moon by natural causes: he was thrown into prison, and with difficulty was relieved by
the influence of Pericles. Protagoras was banished Athens for maintaining the same
doctrine."&nbsp;<a href="#note302"><u>[302]</u></a></p>

<p>Thucydides tells us that an eclipse of the moon delayed the departure of the
expedition against the Syracusans. "The preparations were made, and they were on the
point of sailing, when the moon, being just then at the full, was eclipsed. The mass of
the army was greatly moved, and called upon the generals to remain. Nicias himself, who
was too much under the influence of divination and omens, refused even to discuss the
question of their removal until they had remained thrice nine days, as the soothsayers
prescribed. This was the reason why the departure of the Athenians was finally
delayed."&nbsp;<a href="#note303"><u>[303]</u></a></p>

<p>"At any eclipse of the moone, the Romanes would take their brazen pots and pannes, and
beat them, lifting up many torches and linckes lighted, and firebrandes into the aire,
thinking by these superstitious meanes to reclaime the moone to her light."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note304"><u>[304]</u></a></p>

<p><i>The Constantinople Messenger</i> of December 23rd, 1880, contains the
following:--"Mgr. Mamarbasci, who represents the Syrian Patriarch at the Porte, and
who resides in St. Peter's Monastery in Galata, underwent a singular experience on the
evening of the last eclipse of the moon. Hearing a great noise outside of the firing of
revolvers and pistols, he opened his window to see what could be the cause of so much
waste of powder. Being a native of Aleppo, he was at no loss to understand the cause of
the disturbance as soon as he cast his eye on the heavens, and he therefore immediately
withdrew his head from the window again. Hardly had he done so, however, ere a ball
smashed the glass into a thousand pieces. Rising from the seat into which he had but just
sat down, he perceived a conical ball on the floor of his room, which there is every
reason to believe would have killed him on the spot had he remained a moment longer on
the spot he had just quitted. From the yard of the mosque of Arab-Djami, which is in
front of the prelate's window, the bullet had, it appears, been fired with the intention
of frightening the dragon or bear which, according to oriental superstition, lies in wait
to devour the moon at its eclipse. It is a fortunate circumstance that the Syrian
ecclesiastic escaped scathless from the snares laid to destroy the celestial
dragon."&nbsp;<a href="#note305"><u>[305]</u></a></p>

<p>In the <i>Edda</i>, an ancient collection of Scandinavian poetry, embodying the
national mythology, Managarmer is the monster who sometimes swallows up the moon, and
stains the heaven and the air with blood. "Here," says M. Mallett, "we have the cause of
eclipses; and it is upon this very ancient opinion that the general practice is founded,
of making noises at that time, to fright away the monster, who would otherwise devour the
two great luminaries."&nbsp;<a href="#note306"><u>[306]</u></a> Of the Germans, Grimm
says:--"In a lighted candle, if a piece of the wick gets half detached and makes it
burn away too fast, they say 'a <i>wolf</i> (as well as a thief) is in the candle'; this
too is like the wolf devouring the sun or moon. Eclipses of sun or moon have been a
terror to many heathen nations; the incipient and increasing obscuration of the luminous
orb marks for them the moment when the gaping jaws of the wolf threaten to devour it, and
they think by loud cries to bring it succour."&nbsp;<a href="#note307"><u>[307]</u></a>
And again:--"The personality of the sun and moon shows itself moreover in a fiction
that has well-nigh gone the round of the world. These two, in their unceasing unflagging
career through the void of heaven, appear to be in flight, avoiding some pursuer. A pair
of wolves are on their track, <i>Sk&ouml;ll</i> dogging the steps of the sun, <i>Hati</i>
of the moon: they come of a giant race, the mightiest of whom, M&acirc;nagarmr
(moon-dog), apparently but another name for Hati, is sure some day to <i>overtake and
swallow the moon</i>."&nbsp;<a href="#note308"><u>[308]</u></a> Francis Osborn, whose
<i>Advice</i> contains, in the opinion of Hallam, "a considerable sprinkling of sound
sense and observation," thus counsels his son: "Imitate not the wild Irish or Welch, who,
during eclipses, run about beating kettles and pans, thinking their clamour and vexations
available to the assistance of the higher orbs."&nbsp;<a href="#note309"><u>[309]</u></a>
"In eclipses of the moon, the Greenlanders carry boxes and kettles to the roofs of their
houses, and beat on them as hard as they can."&nbsp;<a href="#note310"><u>[310]</u></a>
With the Californian Indians, "on an eclipse, all is consternation. They congregate and
sing, as some say to appease, and others to frighten, the evil spirits. They believe that
the devils are eating up the luminary, and they do not cease until it comes forth in its
wonted splendour."&nbsp;<a href="#note311"><u>[311]</u></a> Among certain Indian tribes
"dogs were supposed to stand in some peculiar relation to the moon, probably because they
howl at it, and run at night; uncanny practices which have cost them dear in reputation.
The custom prevailed among tribes so widely asunder as Peruvians, Tupis, Creeks,
Iroquois, Algonkins, and Greenland Eskimos, to thrash the curs most soundly during an
eclipse. The Creeks explained this by saying that the big dog was swallowing the sun, and
that by whipping the little ones they could make him desist. What the big dog was they
were not prepared to say. We know. It was the night goddess, represented by the dog, who
was thus shrouding the world at midday."&nbsp;<a href="#note312"><u>[312]</u></a></p>

<p>It is well known that Columbus found his acquaintance with the calculations of
astronomy of great practical value. For when, during his last expedition, he was reduced
to famine by the inhabitants of the newly discovered continent, who kept him and his
companions prisoners, he, aware that an eclipse was at hand, threatened to deprive them
of the light of the moon, if they did not forthwith bring him provisions. At first they
did not care; but when the moon disappeared, they brought abundance of supplies, with
much entreaty of pardon. This occurred on the 1st day of March, 1504, a date which modern
tables of lunar eclipses may fully verify.</p>

<p>"In the Mexican mythology we read of the woman serpent, or the moon, devoured by the
sun, a myth probably descriptive of the changes in the phases of the moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note313"><u>[313]</u></a> More probably this myth referred to the moon's eclipse; for
Bradford tells us that "the Mexicans believed when there was an eclipse of the sun or
moon, that one of those bodies was being devoured by the other. The Peruvians believed
these phenomena portended some great calamity; that the eclipsed body was sick and about
to die, in which case the world would perish. As soon as an eclipse commenced, they made
a dreadful noise with their musical instruments; they struck their dogs and made them
howl, in the hope that the moon, which they believed had an affection for those animals
in consequence of some signal service which they had rendered her, would have pity on
their cries. The Araucanians called eclipses the 'deaths' of the sun and
moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note314"><u>[314]</u></a> In Aglio we are told of the Mexicans that
"in the year of Five Rabbits, or in 1510, there was an eclipse of the sun; they take no
account of the eclipses of the moon, but only of those of the sun; for they say that the
sun devours the moon when an eclipse of the moon takes place."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note315"><u>[315]</u></a> "The Tlascaltecs, regarding the sun and the moon as husband
and wife, believed eclipses to be domestic quarrels. Ribas tells how the Sinaloas held
that the moon in an eclipse was darkened with the dust of battle. Her enemy had come upon
her, and a terrible fight, big with consequence to those on earth, went on in heaven. In
wild excitement the people beat on the sides of their houses, encouraging the moon, and
shooting flights of arrows up into the sky to distract her adversary. Much the same as
this was also done by certain Californians."&nbsp;<a href="#note316"><u>[316]</u></a> "At
a lunar eclipse the Orinoko Indians seized their hoes and laboured with exemplary vigour
on their growing corn, saying the moon was veiling herself in anger at their habitual
laziness."&nbsp;<a href="#note317"><u>[317]</u></a> The umbrated moon did good in this
way: as many of us remember the beautiful comet of 1858 did good, when it frightened some
trembling Londoners into a speedy settlement of old debts, in anticipation of the final
account. Ellis says of the Tahitians: "An eclipse of the moon filled them with dismay;
they supposed the planet was <i>natua</i>, or under the influence of the spell of some
evil spirit that was destroying it. Hence they repaired to the temple, and offered
prayers for the moon's release. Some imagined that on an eclipse, the sun and moon were
swallowed by the god which they had by neglect offended. Liberal presents were offered,
which were supposed to induce the god to abate his anger, and eject the luminaries of day
and night from his stomach."&nbsp;<a href="#note318"><u>[318]</u></a> The Tongans or
Friendly Islanders have a notion that the earth's surface is flat, that the sun and moon
"pass through the sky and come back some way, they know not how. When the moon is
eclipsed, they attribute the phenomenon to a thick cloud passing over it: the same with
the sun."&nbsp;<a href="#note319"><u>[319]</u></a> In the Hervey Islands, the common
exclamation during an eclipse is, "Alas! a divinity has devoured the moon!"</p>

<p>Finally, to close this chapter where it commenced, in Chaldaea, the cradle of
<i>star-reading</i>, Sir Austen Henry Layard says: "I gained, as other travellers have
done before me, some credit for wisdom and superhuman knowledge by predicting, through
the aid of an almanack, a partial eclipse of the moon. It duly took place, to the great
dismay of my guests, who well-nigh knocked out the bottoms of all my kitchen utensils in
their endeavour to frighten away the jins who had thus laid hold of the planet. The
common notion amongst ignorant Mahometans is, that an eclipse is caused by some evil
spirit catching hold of the sun or moon. On such occasions, in Eastern towns, the whole
population assembles with pots, pans, and other equally rude instruments of music, and,
with the aid of their lungs, make a din and turmoil which might suffice to drive away a
whole army of evil spirits, even at so great a distance."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note320"><u>[320]</u></a> We have reached three general conclusions. <i>First</i>, when
the moon is occulted by the earth it is believed to be devoured by some evil demon, or by
wolves or dogs. This is the superstitious vagary of the Hindoos, the Chinese, Asiatics
generally, Europeans, Africans, Americans, and Polynesians. <i>Secondly</i>, a lunar
eclipse is the precursor of some dreadful calamity to the inhabitants of the earth. This
notion is also traceable in every quarter of the globe. And <i>thirdly</i>, during the
obscuration the light of the moon is reddened, and at last extinguished, by the blood
which flows from its wounds; which belief originates with the <i>Edda</i>, and obtains in
the Western world. Students of sacred prophecy may still elect to deem these occurrences
that are purely natural as of supernatural significance, and may risk the interests of
true religion in their insane disregard of science; but the truth will remain, in spite
of their misconceptions, that eclipses of the moon have no concern with the moral destiny
of mankind.</p><br>
<a name="III4" id="III4"></a>IV. LUNAR INFLUENCES.

<p>The superficies of the earth being twice seven times that of the moon, what an
influence the earth must exercise over its satellite! We may be unable to describe this
influence in all of its effects; but we may observe its existence in some of its apparent
signs. The moon not only turns while we turn, but its rotations on its axis keep exact
time with its revolutions round our globe; it accompanies us as we encircle the sun,
facing us all the while, never turning its back upon us; it waits on us like a
link-bearer, or lackey; is our admiring Boswell, living and moving and having its being
in the equability it derives from attending its illustrious master. An African sage once
illustrated this philosophical principle of the greater controlling the less, by the
following fine conundrum. "Why does the dog waggle his tail?" This problem, being beyond
his auditors, was given up. The sage made answer, "Because the dog is bigger than the
tail; else the tail would waggle the dog." It is alarming to contemplate the effect which
the moon might have upon our august earth, if it were fourteen times larger instead of
fourteen times smaller in extent of surface. As it is, Luna's influences are so many and
so mighty, that we will require considerable space merely to set them in order, and to
substantiate them with a few facts. We believe that most, if not all, of them, are the
offspring of superstition; but we shall none the less find them in every land, in every
age. In the nineteenth century as well as in the dark ages, in London as well as in the
ends of the earth, men of all colours and clans are found turning their faces heavenward
to read their duty and destiny in the oracular face of the moon. Many consult their
almanacks more than their Bibles, and follow the lunar phases as their sole
interpretation of the will of God.</p>

<p>Among those who worship the moon as a personal deity, whether beneficent or malign,
its influences are of course welcomed or dreaded as the manifestations of supreme power.
In South America, for example, "the Botocudos are said to give the highest rank among the
heavenly bodies to Taru, the moon, as causing thunder and lightning and the failure of
vegetables and fruits, and as even sometimes falling to the earth, whereby many men
die."&nbsp;<a href="#note321"><u>[321]</u></a> So, in Africa, the emotions of the
worshippers vary with their subjective views of their god. "Negro tribes seem almost
universally to greet the new moon, whether in delight or disgust. The Guinea people fling
themselves about with droll gestures, and pretend to throw firebrands at it; the Ashango
men behold it with superstitious fear; the Fetu negroes jumped thrice into the air with
hands together and gave thanks."&nbsp;<a href="#note322"><u>[322]</u></a> But even
amongst men who neither personify nor deify the moon, its dominion over the air, earth,
and sea, over human health and happiness, is held to be so all-important, that if the
Maker and Monarch of all were jealous, as men count jealousy, such lunar fears and
affections would be unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to particulars, rising from inorganic nature to beings endowed with the
highest instruments of life. Even the mineral kingdom is supposed to be swayed by the
moon; for in Scotland, Martin says, "The natives told me, that the rock on the east side
of Harries, in the Sound of Island Glass, hath a vacuity near the front, on the
north-west side of the Sound; in which they say there is a stone that they call the
<i>Lunar Stone</i>, which advances and retires according to the increase and decrease of
the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note323"><u>[323]</u></a> An ancient instance of belief in
lunar influence upon inanimate matter is cited by Plutarch. "<i>Euthydemus</i> of
<i>Sunium</i> feasted us upon a time at his house, and set before us a wilde bore, of
such bignesse, that all wee at the table wondred thereat; but he told us that there was
another brought unto him farre greater; mary naught it was, and corrupted in the
carriage, by the beames of the moone-shine; whereof he made great doubt and question, how
it should come to passe; for that he could not conceive, nor see any reason, but that the
sunne should rather corrupt flesh, being as it was, farre hotter than the
moone."&nbsp;<a href="#note324"><u>[324]</u></a> Pliny said that the moon corrupted
carcases of animals exposed to its malefic rays. As with the lifeless, so with the
living. "The inhabitants of St. Kilda observe that when the April moon goes far in May,
the fowls are ten or twelve days later in laying their eggs than ordinarily they use to
be."&nbsp;<a href="#note325"><u>[325]</u></a> The influence of the moon upon vegetation
is an opinion hoary with age. In the <i>Zend-Avesta</i> we read, "And when the light of
the moon waxes warmer, golden-hued plants grow on from the earth during the
spring."&nbsp;<a href="#note326"><u>[326]</u></a> An old English author
writes:--</p>

<blockquote>
"Sowe peason and beanes, in the wane of the moone,<br>
Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soone<br>
That they with the planet may rest and arise,<br>
And flourish, with bearing most plentiful wise."&nbsp;<a href="#note327"><u>[327]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Cucumbers, radishes, turnips, leeks, lilies, horseradish, saffron, and other plants,
are said to increase during the fulness of the moon; but onions, on the contrary, are
much larger and are better nourished during the decline.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note328"><u>[328]</u></a> To recur to Plutarch is to find him saying: "The moone
showeth her power most evidently even in those bodies, which have neither sense nor
lively breath; for carpenters reject the timber of trees fallen in the ful-moone, as
being soft and tender, subject also to the worme and putrifaction, and that quickly, by
reason of excessive moisture; husbandmen, likewise, make haste to gather up their wheat
and other grain from the threshing-floore, in the wane of the moone, and toward the end
of the month, that being hardened thus with drinesse, the heape in the garner may keepe
the better from being fustie, and continue the longer; whereas corne which is inned and
laied up at the full of the moone, by reason of the softnesse and over-much moisture, of
all other, doth most cracke and burst. It is commonly said also, that if a leaven be
laied in the ful-moone, the paste will rise and take leaven better."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note329"><u>[329]</u></a> Still in Cornwall the people gather all their
medicinal plants when the moon is of a certain age; which practice is very
probably a relic of druidical superstition. &quot;In some parts it is a prevalent
belief that the growth of mushrooms is influenced by the changes of the moon,
and in Essex the subjoined rule is often scrupulously adhered to:--</p>

<blockquote>
"When the moon is at the full,<br>
Mushrooms you may freely pull<br>
But when the moon is on the wane,<br>
Wait ere you think to pluck again.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note330"><u>[330]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Henderson says, "I may, perhaps, mention here, that apples are said to 'shrump up' in
Devonshire if picked when the moon is waning."&nbsp;<a href="#note331"><u>[331]</u></a> A
writer of miscellaneous literature tells us that "it has been demonstrated that moonlight
has the power, <i>per se</i>, of awakening the sensitive plant, and consequently that it
possesses an influence of some kind on vegetation. It is true that the influence is very
feeble, compared with that of the sun; but the action is established, and the question
remains, what is the practical value of the fact? 'It will immediately,' says Professor
Lindley, 'occur to the reader that possibly the screens which are drawn down over
hothouses at night, to prevent loss of heat by radiation, may produce some unappreciated
injury by cutting off the rays of the moon, which nature intended to fall upon plants as
much as the rays of the sun."&nbsp;<a href="#note332"><u>[332]</u></a> The same author
says elsewhere, "Columella, Cato, Vitruvius, and Pliny, all had their notions of the
advantages of cutting timber at certain ages of the moon; a piece of mummery which is
still preserved in the royal ordonnances of France to the conservators of the forests,
who are directed to fell oaks only 'in the wane of the moon' and 'when the wind is at
north.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note333"><u>[333]</u></a> Of trees, astrologers affirm that the
moon rules the palm tree (which the ancients say "sends forth a twig every time the moon
rises") and all plants, trees, and herbs that are juicy and full of sap.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note334"><u>[334]</u></a></p>

<p>"A description of the New Netherlands, written about 1650, remarks that the savages of
that land 'ascribe great influence to the moon over crops.' This venerable superstition,
common to all races, still lingers among our own farmers, many of whom continue to
observe 'the signs of the moon' in sowing grain, setting out trees, cutting timber, and
other rural avocations."&nbsp;<a href="#note335"><u>[335]</u></a> What is here said of
the new world applies also to the old; for in England a current expression in
Huntingdonshire is "a dark Christmas sends a fine harvest": dark meaning moonless.</p>

<p>Of the lunar influence upon the tides, old John Lilly writes: "There is nothing
thought more admirable, or commendable in the sea, than the ebbing and flowing; and shall
the moone, from whom the sea taketh this virtue, be accounted fickle for encreasing and
decreasing?"&nbsp;<a href="#note336"><u>[336]</u></a> Another writer of the sixteenth
century says, "The moone is founde, by plaine experience, to beare her greatest stroke
uppon the seas, likewise in all things that are moiste, and by consequence in the braines
of man."&nbsp;<a href="#note337"><u>[337]</u></a> Dennys tells us that "the influence
exerted by the moon on tides is recognised by the Chinese."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note338"><u>[338]</u></a> What some record in prose, others repeat in rhyme. The
following is <i>one</i> kind of poetry.</p>

<blockquote>
"Moone changed, keepes closet, three daies as a Queene,<br>
Er she in hir prime, will of any be scene:<br>
If great she appereth, it showreth out,<br>
If small she appereth, it signifieth drout.<br>
At change or at full, come it late, or else soone,<br>
Maine sea is at highest, at midnight and noone,<br>
But yet in the creekes, it is later high flood:<br>
Through farnesse of running, by reason as good."&nbsp;<a href="#note339"><u>[339]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Indirectly, through the influence upon the tides, the moon is concerned in human
mortality.</p>

<blockquote>
"Tyde flowing is feared, for many a thing,<br>
Great danger to such as be sick it doth bring.<br>
Sea eb, by long ebbing, some respit doth give,<br>
And sendeth good comfort, to such as shal live."&nbsp;<a href="#note340"><u>[340]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Henderson says, "It is a common belief along the east coast of England, from
Northumberland to Kent, that deaths mostly occur during the falling of the
tide."&nbsp;<a href="#note341"><u>[341]</u></a> Every reader of the inimitable Dickens
will be reminded here of the death of poor old Barkis.</p>

<p>"'He's a-going out with the tide,' said Mr. Peggotty to me, behind his hand.</p>

<p>"My eyes were dim, and so were Mr. Peggotty's; but I repeated in a whisper, 'With the
tide?'</p>

<p>"'People can't die, along the coast,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'except when the tide's
pretty nigh out. They can't be born, unless it's pretty nigh in-not properly born, till
flood. He's a-going out with the tide. It's ebb at half-arter three, slack water half an
hour. If he lives till it turns, he'll hold his own till past the flood, and go out with
the next tide.'</p>

<p>"'He's coming to himself,' said Peggotty.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peggotty touched me, and whispered with much awe and reverence, 'They are both
a-going out fast.'</p>

<p>"He now opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I was on the point of asking him if he knew me, when he tried to stretch out
his arm, and said to me distinctly, with a pleasant smile,--</p>

<p>"'Barkis is willin'.'</p>

<p>"And, it being low water, he went out with the tide."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note342"><u>[342]</u></a></p>

<p>That the rise and fall of our tides twice a day, with spring and neap tides twice in
the lunar month, are the effect of the combined action of the sun and moon, is never
called in question. The water under the moon is drawn up from the earth, and the earth is
drawn from the water on the opposite side, the consequence of which is two high tides in
the two hemispheres at the same hour. The rotation of the earth bringing the same point
of the ocean twice under the moon's meridian, once under the upper meridian and once
under the lower, each hemisphere has two high tides in the course of the day. The spring
tide is caused by the attractive force of the sun and moon acting in conjunction, or in a
straight line; and the neap tide is caused by the moon being in quadrature, or when the
sun and moon are at right angles to each other. They counteract each other's influence,
and our tides arc therefore low. So much is science; but the connection of ebb and flow
with life and death is superstition.</p>

<p>From a very remote antiquity, in the twilight of natural astrology, a belief arose
that changes in the weather were occasioned by the moon.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note343"><u>[343]</u></a> That the notion lives on, and will not soon die, is clear to
any one who is conversant with current literature and common folk-lore. Even intelligent,
well-informed people lend it countenance. Professor Newcomb, of Washington, rightly says:
"Thus far there is no evidence that the moon directly affects the earth or its
inhabitants in any other way than by her attraction, which is so minute as to be entirely
insensible except in the ways we have described. A striking illustration of the
fallibility of the human judgment when not disciplined by scientific training is afforded
by the opinions which have at various times obtained currency respecting a supposed
influence of the moon on the weather. Neither in the reason of the case nor in
observations do we find any real support for such a theory. It must, however, be admitted
that opinions of this character are not confined to the uneducated."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note344"><u>[344]</u></a> Mr. Edward B. Tylor holds similar language: "The notion that
the weather changes with the moon's quarterings is still held with great vigour in
England. That educated people to whom exact weather records are accessible should still
find satisfaction in the fanciful lunar rule, is an interesting case of intellectual
survival."&nbsp;<a href="#note345"><u>[345]</u></a> No marvel that the "heathen Chinee"
considers lunar observations as forecasting scarcity of provisions he is but of the same
blood with his British brother, who takes his tea and sends him opium. "The Hakkas (and
also many Puntis) believe that if in the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth month
(mid autumn) there are clouds obscuring the moon before midnight, it is a sign that oil
and salt will become very dear. If, however, there are clouds obscuring the moon after
midnight, the price of rice will, it is supposed, undergo a similar
change."&nbsp;<a href="#note346"><u>[346]</u></a></p>

<p>One of our provincial proverbs is: "So many days old the moon is on Michaelmas Day, so
many floods after." Sometimes a proverb is a short saying spoken after long experience;
at other times it is a small crystal left after a lengthy evaporation. In certain
instances our rural apothegms are sacred relics of extinct but canonized fictions. An
equally wise prediction is that if Christmas comes during a waxing moon we shall have a
very good year; and the nearer to the new moon, the better. But if during a waning moon,
a hard year; and the nearer the end of the moon, so much the worse. Another sage belief
is that the condition of the weather is dependent upon the day of the week upon which the
new moon chances to fall. We are told that "Dr. Forster, of Bruges, well known as a
meteorologist, declares that by the <i>Journal</i> kept by his grandfather, father, and
self, ever since 1767, to the present time, whenever the new moon has fallen on a
<i>Saturday</i>, the following <i>twenty days</i> have been wet and windy, in nineteen
cases out of twenty."&nbsp;<a href="#note347"><u>[347]</u></a> In Italy it is said, "If
the moon change on a Sunday, there will be a flood before the month is out." New moon on
Monday, or moon-day, is, of course, everywhere held a sign of good weather and luck.</p>

<p>That a misty moon is a misfortune to the atmosphere is widely supposed. In
Scotland it is an agricultural maxim among the canny farmers that--</p>

<blockquote>
"If the moon shows like a silver shield,<br>
You need not be afraid to reap your field<br>
But if she rises haloed round,<br>
Soon we'll tread on deluged ground."&nbsp;<a href="#note348"><u>[348]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Others say that a mist is unfavourable only with the new moon, not with the old.</p>

<blockquote>
"An old moon in a mist<br>
Is worth gold in a kist (chest)<br>
But a new moon's mist<br>
Will never lack thirst,"&nbsp;<a href="#note349"><u>[349]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>is a rugged rhyme found in several places. In Cornwall the idea is that--</p>

<blockquote>
"A fog and a small moon<br>
Bring an easterly wind soon."
</blockquote>

<p>The east wind, as we know, is dry. Two of the Shepherd of Banbury's rules are:</p>

<blockquote>
"xii. If mists in the new moon, rain in the old.<br>
xiii. If mists in the old, rain in the new moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note350"><u>[350]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing is a meteorological certainty: the full moon very frequently clears the sky.
But this may be partly accounted for by the fact that a full moon shows the night to be
clear, which in the moon's absence might be called cloudy.</p>

<p>Another observation shows that in proportion to the clearness of the night is its
cold. The clouds covering the earth with no thick blanket, it radiates its heat into
space. This has given rise to the notion that the moon itself reduces our temperature. It
is <i>cold</i> at night without doubt. But the cold moon is so warm when the sun is
shining full on its disk that no creature on earth could endure a moment's contact with
its surface. The centre of the "pale-faced moon" is hotter than boiling water. This
thought may cheer us when "the cold round moon shines deeply down." We may be pardoned if
we take with a tincture of scepticism the following statement "Native Chinese records
aver that on the 18th day of the 6th moon, 1590, snow fell one summer night from the
midst of the moon. The flakes were like fine willow flowers on shreds of
silk."&nbsp;<a href="#note351"><u>[351]</u></a> Instead of cold, it is more likely that
the white moon gives us heat, for from Melloni's letter to Arago it seems to be already
an ascertained fact. Having concentrated the lunar rays with a lens of over three feet
diameter upon his thermoscopic pile, Melloni found that the needle had deviated from
0&deg; 6' to 4&deg; 8', according to the lunar phase. Other thermoscopes may give even
larger indications; but meanwhile the Italian physicist has exploded an error with a
spark of science.</p>

<p>"Another weather guide connected with the moon is, that to see 'the old moon in the
arms of the new one' is reckoned a sign of fine weather; and so is the turning up of the
horns of the new moon. In this position it is supposed to retain the water, which is
imagined to be in it, and which would run out if the horns were turned
down."&nbsp;<a href="#note352"><u>[352]</u></a> On this novel idea of a lunar bason or
saucer, Southey writes from "Keswick, December 29th, 1828," as follows:--"Poor
Littledale has this day explained the cause of our late rains, which have prevailed for
the last six weeks, by a theory which will probably be as new to you as it is to me. 'I
have observed,' he says, 'that, when the moon is turned upward, we have fine weather
after it; but if it is turned down, then we have a wet season; and the reason I think is,
that when it is turned down, it holds no water, like a bason, you know, and then down it
all comes.' There, it will be a long while before the march of intellect shall produce a
theory as original as this, which I find, upon inquiry, to be the popular opinion
here."&nbsp;<a href="#note353"><u>[353]</u></a> George Eliot has taken notice of this
fancy in the burial of "poor old Thias Bede." "They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the
ground afore ye get to the churchyard," said old Martin, as his son came up. "It 'ud ha'
been better luck if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin';
there's no likelihoods of a drop now, an' the moon lies like a boat there, dost see?
That's a sure sign o' fair weather; there's a many as is false, but that's
sure."&nbsp;<a href="#note354"><u>[354]</u></a></p>

<p>In Dekker's <i>Match Me in London</i>, Act i., the King says, "My Lord, doe you see
this change in the moone? Sharp hornes doe threaten windy weather."</p>

<p>In the famous ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, concerning whose origin there has been so
much discussion, without eliciting any very accurate information, we read:</p>

<blockquote>
"O ever alack! my master dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I fear a deadly storm.<br>
I saw the new moon late yestreen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wi' the auld moon in her arm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if ye gang to sea, maister,<br>
I fear we'll suffer harm."&nbsp;<a href="#note355"><u>[355]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Jamieson informs us that "prognostications concerning the weather, during the course
of the month, are generally formed by the country people in Scotland from the appearance
of the <i>new moon</i>. It is considered as an almost infallible presage of bad weather,
if she <i>lies sair on her back</i>, or when her horns are pointed towards the zenith. It
is a similar prognostic, when the new moon appears <i>wi' the auld moon in her arm</i>,
or, in other words, when that part of the moon which is covered with the shadow of the
earth is seen through it."&nbsp;<a href="#note356"><u>[356]</u></a> The last sentence is
a <i>lapsus calami</i>. Dr. Jamieson should have said, when that part of the moon which
is turned from the sun is dimly visible through the reflected light of the earth.</p>

<p>"At Whitby, when the moon is surrounded by a halo with watery clouds, the seamen say
that there will be a change of weather, for the 'moon dogs' are about."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note357"><u>[357]</u></a> At Ulceby, in Lincolnshire, "there is a very prevalent belief
amongst sailors and seafaring men that when a large star or planet is seen near the moon,
or, as they express it, 'a big star is dogging the moon,' that this is a certain
prognostication of wild weather. I have met old sailors having the strongest faith in
this prediction, and who have told me that they have verified it by a long course of
observation."&nbsp;<a href="#note358"><u>[358]</u></a></p>

<p>"Some years ago," says a writer from Torquay, "an old fisherman of this place told me,
on the morning next after a violent gale, that he had foreseen the storm for some time,
as he had observed one star ahead of the moon, towing her, and another astern, chasing
her. 'I know'd 'twas coming, safe enough.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note359"><u>[359]</u></a> The
moon was simply in apparent proximity to two stars; but the old Devonian descried
mischief.</p>

<p>The following incident from Zulu life will be of interest. "1878. A curious phenomenon
occurred 7th January. A bright star appeared near the moon at noonday, the sun shining
brightly. <i>Omen</i>--The natives from this foretold the coming war with the
Amazulu. Intense heat and drought prevailed at this time."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note360"><u>[360]</u></a></p>

<p>Hitherto we have reviewed only the imaginary influences of the moon over inanimate
nature and what are called irrational beings. We have seen that this potent orb is
supposed to affect the lightning and thunder of the air; the rocks and seas, the
vegetables and animals of the earth; and generally to govern terrestrial matters in a
manner altogether its own. Furthermore, we have found these imaginations rooted in all
lands, and among men whose culture might have been expected to refuse such fruitless
excrescences. When classical authors counsel us to set eggs under the hen at new moon,
and to root up trees only when the moon is waning and after mid-day; and when "the
wisest, brightest," if not the "meanest of mankind" seriously attributes to the moon the
extraction of heat, the furtherance of putrification, the increase of moisture, and the
excitement of animal spirits, with the increase of hedges and herbs if cut or set during
certain phases of that body, we can but repeat to ourselves the saying, "The best of men
are but men at the best." The half, however, has not been told; and we must now pass on
to speak of lunar influences upon the birth, health, intellect, and fortune of
microcosmical man.</p>

<p>In the system of astrology, which professed to interpret the events of human existence
by the movements of the stars, the moon was one of the primary planets. As man was looked
upon in the light of a microcosm, or world in miniature, so the several parts of his
constitution were viewed as but a reproduction in brief of the great parts of the vast
organism. Creation was a living, intelligent being, whose two eyes were the sun and the
moon, whose body was the earth, whose intellect was the ether, whose wings were the
heavens. Man was an epitome of all this; and as the functions of the less were held to
correspond with the functions of the greater, the microcosm with the macrocosm, man's
movements could be inferred by first ascertaining the motions of the universe. The moon,
having dominion in the twelve "houses" of heaven, through which she passed in the course
of the year, her <i>aspects</i> to the other bodies were considered as of prime
significance, in indicating benignant or malignant influences upon human life. This
system, which was based upon ignorance and superstition, and upheld by arbitrary rules
and unreasoning credulity, is so repugnant to all principles of science and common sense,
that it would be unworthy of notice, if we did not know that to this day there are
educated persons still to be seen poring over old almanacs and peering into the darkness
of divination, to read their own fortune or that of their children by the dim light of
some lucky or unlucky configuration of the planets with the moon. The wheel of fortune
yet revolves, and the despotism of astrology is not dead. The lunar influence is
considered supreme in the hour of birth. Nay, with some the moon is potential even before
birth. In Iceland it is said: "If a pregnant woman sit with her face turned towards the
moon, her child will be a lunatic."&nbsp;<a href="#note361"><u>[361]</u></a> And this
imagination obtains at home as well as abroad. We are told that "astrologers ascribe the
most powerful influence to the moon on every person, both for success and health,
according to her zodiacal and mundane position at birth, and her aspects to other
planets. The sensual faculties depend almost entirely on the moon, and as she is aspected
so are the moral or immoral tendencies. She has great influence always upon every
person's constitution."&nbsp;<a href="#note362"><u>[362]</u></a> This is the doctrine of
a book published not thirty years ago. Another work, issued also in London, says,
"Cynthia, 'the queen of heaven,' as the ancients termed her, or the MOON, the companion
of the earth, and chief source of our evening light, is a cold, moist, watery, phlegmatic
planet, variable to an extreme, in astrological science; and partaking of good or evil,
as she is aspected by good or evil stars. When angular and unafflicted in a nativity, she
is the promissory pledge of great success in life and continual good fortune. She
produces a full stature, fair, pale complexion, round face, gray eyes, short arms, thick
hands and feet, smooth, corpulent, and phlegmatic body. Blemishes in the eyes, or a
peculiar weakness in the sight, is the result of her being afflicted by the Sun. Her
conjunction, semi-sextile, sextile, or trine, to Jupiter, is exceeding fortunate; and she
is said by the old Astrologers to govern the <i>brain</i>, <i>stomach</i>, <i>bowels</i>,
<i>left eye</i> of the male, and <i>right eye</i> of the female. Her usual diseases are
rheumatism, consumption, palsy, cholic, apoplexy, vertigo, lunacy, scrophula, smallpox,
dropsy, etc.; also most diseases peculiar to young children."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note363"><u>[363]</u></a> Such teaching is not a whit in advance of Plutarch's odd
dictum that the moon has a "special hand in the birth of children."</p>

<p>If this belief have disciples in London, it is not by any means confined to that city.
In Sweden great influence is ascribed to the moon, not only in regulating the weather,
but as affecting all the affairs of man's daily life. The lower orders, and many of the
better sort, will not fell a tree for agricultural purposes in the wane of that orb, lest
it should shrink and decay; nor will the housewife then slaughter for her family, lest
the meat should shrivel and melt away in the pot. The moon is the domestic deity, whom
the household must fear: the Fortuna who presides over the daily doings of sublunary
mortals. In the matter of birth, we find Francis Bacon affirming that "the calculation of
nativities, fortunes, good or bad hours of business, and the like fatalities, are mere
levities that have little in them of certainty and solidity, and may be plainly confuted
by physical reasons";&nbsp;<a href="#note364"><u>[364]</u></a> and yet in his Natural
History he writes: "It may be that children and young cattle that are brought forth in
the full of the moon, are stronger and larger than those that are brought forth in the
wane."&nbsp;<a href="#note365"><u>[365]</u></a> There surely can be no superstition in
studying the moon's conjunctions and oppositions if her influence in a nativity have the
slightest weight. And this influence is still widely maintained by philosophers who read
Bacon, as well as by the peasants who read nothing at all. "In Cornwall, when a child is
born in the interval between an old moon and the first appearance of a new one, it is
said that it will never live to reach the age of puberty. Hence the saying, 'no moon, no
man.' In the same county, too, when a boy is born in the wane of the moon, it is believed
that the next birth will be a girl, and vice versa; and it is also commonly said that
when a birth takes place on the 'growing of the moon' the next child will be of the same
sex."&nbsp;<a href="#note366"><u>[366]</u></a></p>

<p>As a natural proceeding, we find that the moon has influence when the child is weaned.
Caledonian mothers very carefully observe the lunar phases on this account. Jamieson
tells us that "this superstition, with respect to the fatal influence of a waning moon,
seems to have been general in Scotland. In Angus, it is believed, that, if a child be put
from the breast during the waning of the moon, it will decay all the time that the moon
continues to wane."&nbsp;<a href="#note367"><u>[367]</u></a> So in the heart of Europe,
"the Lithuanian precept to wean boys at a waxing, but girls on a waning moon, no doubt to
make the boys sturdy and the girls slim and delicate, is a fair match for the Orkney
Islanders' objection to marrying except with a growing moon, while some even wish for a
flowing tide."&nbsp;<a href="#note368"><u>[368]</u></a> As to marriage, the ancient
Greeks considered the day of the full moon the most propitious period for that ceremony.
In Euripides, Clytemnestra having asked Agamemnon when he intended to give Iphigenia in
marriage to Achilles, he replies, "When the full moon comes forth with good luck." In
Pindar, too, this season is preferred.&nbsp;<a href="#note369"><u>[369]</u></a></p>

<p>Lunar influences over physical health and disease must be a fearful contemplation to
those who are of a superstitious turn. There is no malady within the whole realm of
pathology which the moon's destroying angel cannot inflict; and from the crown of the
head to the sole of the foot the entire man is at the mercy of her beams. We have all
seen those disgusting woodcuts to which the following just condemnation refers: "The
moon's influence on parts of the human body, as given in some old-fashioned almanacs, is
an entire <i>fallacy</i>; it is most untrue and absurd, often indecent, and is a
discredit to the age we live in."&nbsp;<a href="#note370"><u>[370]</u></a> Most of these
inartistic productions are framed upon the assumption of the old alchymists that the
physiological functions were regulated by planetary influence. The sun controlled the
heart, the moon the brain, Jupiter the lungs, Saturn the spleen, Mars the liver, Venus
the kidneys, and Mercury the reproductive powers. But even with this distribution among
the heavenly bodies the moon was allowed plenipotentiary sway. As in mythology it is the
god or goddess of water, so in astrology it is the embodiment of moisture, and therefore
rules the humours which circulate throughout the human system. No wonder that phlebotomy
prevailed so long as the reign of the moon endured. "This lunar planet," says La
Martini&egrave;re, "is damp of itself, but, by the radiation of the sun, is of various
temperaments, as follows: in its first quadrant it is warm and damp, at which time it is
good to let the blood of sanguine persons; in its second it is warm and dry, at which
time it is good to bleed the choleric; in its third quadrant it is cold and moist, and
phlegmatic people may be bled; and in its fourth it is cold and dry, at which time it is
well to bleed the melancholic." Whatever the moon's phase may be, let blood be shed! We
are reminded here of that sanguifluous theology, which even Christians of a certain
temperament seem to enjoy, while they sing of fountains filled with blood: as though a
God of love could take delight in the effusion of precious life. La Martini&egrave;re
continues, and physicians will make a note of his words: "It is a thing quite necessary
to those who meddle with medicine to understand the movement of this planet, in order to
discern the causes of sickness. And as the moon is often in conjunction with Saturn, many
attribute to it apoplexy, paralysis, epilepsy, jaundice, hydropsy, lethargy, catapory,
catalepsy, colds, convulsions, trembling of the limbs, etc., etc. I have noticed that
this planet has such enormous power over living creatures, that children born at the
first quarter of the declining moon are more subject to illness, so that children born
when there is no moon, if they live, are weak, delicate, and sickly, or are of little
mind or idiots. Those who are born under the house of the moon which is Cancer, are of a
phlegmatic disposition."&nbsp;<a href="#note371"><u>[371]</u></a></p>

<p>That the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans believed in the deleterious influence of
the moon on the health of man, is very evident. The Talmud refers the words, "Though I
walk through the valley of the shadow of death" (Ps. xxiii. 4) "to him who sleeps in the
shadow of the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note372"><u>[372]</u></a> Another Psalm (cxxi. 6)
reads, literally, "By day the sun shall not smite thee, and the moon in the night." In
the Greek Testament we find further proof of this belief. Among those who thronged the
Great Teacher (Matt. iv. 24) were the <font face=
"Times New Roman">&sigma;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&iota;&alpha;&zeta;&omicron;&mu;&#941;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</font>
(<i>lunatici</i>, Beza; <i>i lunatici</i>, Diodati; <i>les lunatiques</i>,
French version; &quot;those who were lunatick&quot;). The Revised Version of 1881 reads
&quot;epileptic,&quot; but that is a comment, not a translation. So again (Matt. xvii. 15)
we read of a boy who was &quot;lunatick&quot;--<font face=
"Times New Roman">&sigma;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&iota;&#940;&zeta;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</font>.
On which Archbishop Trench remarks, "Of course the word originally, like <font face=
"Times New Roman">&mu;&alpha;&nu;&#943;&alpha;</font> (from <font face=
"Times New Roman">&mu;&eta;&nu;&eta;)</font> and lunaticus, arose from the widespread
belief of the evil influence of the moon on the human frame."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note373"><u>[373]</u></a> Jerome attributes all this superstition to daemons, of which
men were the dupes. "The <i>lunatics</i>," he says, "were not really smitten by the moon,
but were believed to be so, through the subtlety of the daemons, who by observing the
seasons of the moon sought to bring an evil report against the creature, that it might
redound to the blasphemy of the Creator."&nbsp;<a href="#note374"><u>[374]</u></a> Demons
or no demons, faith in moonstroke is clear enough. Pliny was of opinion that the moon
induced drowsiness and stupor in those who slept under her beams. Galen, in the second
century, taught that those who were born when the moon was falciform, or sickle-shaped,
were weak and short-lived, while those born during the full moon were vigorous and of
long life. He also took notice of the lunar influence in epilepsy&nbsp;<a href=
"#note375"><u>[375]</u></a> of which fearful malady a modern physician writes, "This
disease has been known from the earliest antiquity, and is remarkable as being that
malady which, even beyond insanity, was made the foundation of the doctrine of possession
by evil spirits, alike in the Jewish, Grecian, and Roman philosophy."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note376"><u>[376]</u></a> The terrible disorder was a fact; and evil spirits or the
moon had to bear the blame.</p>

<p>In modern times the moon is no less the deity of insalutary disaster. Of Mexico,
Brinton says: "Very different is another aspect of the moon-goddess, and well might the
Mexicans paint her with two colours. The beneficent dispenser of harvests and offspring,
she nevertheless has a portentous and terrific phase. She is also the goddess of the
night, the dampness, and the cold; she engenders the miasmatic poisons that rack our
bones; she conceals in her mantle the foe who takes us unawares; she rules those vague
shapes which fright us in the dim light; the causeless sounds of night or its more
oppressive silence are familiar to her; she it is who sends dreams wherein gods and
devils have their sport with man, and slumber, the twin brother of the
grave."&nbsp;<a href="#note377"><u>[377]</u></a> So farther south, "the Brazilian mother
carefully shielded her infant from the lunar rays, believing that they would produce
sickness; the hunting tribes of our own country will not sleep in its light, nor leave
their game exposed to its action. We ourselves have not outgrown such words as lunatic,
moon-struck, and the like. Where did we get these ideas? The philosophical historian of
medicine, Kurt Sprengel, traces them to the primitive and popular medical theories of
ancient Egypt, in accordance with which all maladies were the effects of the anger of the
goddess Isis, the moisture, the moon."&nbsp;<a href="#note378"><u>[378]</u></a> Perhaps
Dr. Brinton's own Mexican myth is a better elucidation of this origin of nocturnal evil
than that which traces it to Egypt. According to an ancient tradition in Mexico, "it is
said that in the absence of the sun all mankind lingered in darkness. Nothing but a human
sacrifice could hasten his arrival. Then Metzli, the moon, led forth one Nanahuatl, the
leprous, and building a pyre, the victim threw himself in its midst. Straightway Metzli
followed his example, and as she disappeared in the bright flames, the sun rose over the
horizon. Is not this a reference to the kindling rays of the aurora, in which the dark
and baleful night is sacrificed, and in whose light the moon presently fades away, and
the sun comes forth?"&nbsp;<a href="#note379"><u>[379]</u></a> We venture to think that
it is, and that it is nearest to a natural explanation of purely natural effects.</p>

<p>Coming next to Britain, we find that "no prejudice has been more firmly rivetted than
the influence of the moon over the human frame, originating perhaps in some superstition
more ancient than recorded by the earliest history. The frequent intercourse of Scotland
with the north may have conspired to disseminate or renew the veneration of a luminary so
highly venerated there, in counteracting the more southern ecclesiastical
ordinances."&nbsp;<a href="#note380"><u>[380]</u></a> Forbes Leslie surely goes too far,
and mixes matters up too much, when he writes: "An ancient belief, adhered to by the
ignorant after being denounced and apparently disproved by the learned, is now admitted
to be a fact; viz. the influence of the moon in certain diseases. This, from various
circumstances, is more apparent in some of the Asiatic countries, and may have given rise
to the custom which extended into Britain, of exposing sick children on the
housetops."&nbsp;<a href="#note381"><u>[381]</u></a> We know that the <i>solar</i> rays,
from the time of Hippocrates, the reputed "father of medicine," were believed by the
Greeks to prolong life; and that the Romans built terraces on the tops of their houses
called <i>solaria</i>, where they enjoyed their solar baths. "Levato sole levatur
morbus," was one of their medical axioms. But who ever heard of the <i>lunar</i> rays as
beneficial? If sick children were exposed on the housetops, it must have been in the
daytime; and, unless it were intended as an alterative, it is difficult to see what
connection this had with the belief that disease was the product of the lunar beam.
Besides, is the moon's influence in disease an admitted fact? The "certain diseases"
should be specified, and their lunar origin sustained.</p>

<p>The following strange superstition is singularly like that interpolated legend in the
Gospel of John, about the angel troubling the pool of Bethesda. In this case the
medicinal virtue seems to come with the change of the moon. But in both cases
supernatural agency is equally mythical. "A cave in the neighbourhood of Dunskey ought
also to be mentioned, on account of the great veneration in which it is held by the
people. At the change of the moon (which is still considered with superstitious
reverence), it is usual to bring, even from a great distance, infirm persons, and
particularly ricketty children, whom they often suppose bewitched, to bathe in a stream
which pours from the hill, and then dry them in the cave."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note382"><u>[382]</u></a></p>

<p>Those who are in danger of apoplexy, or other cerebral disease, through indulgence too
freely in various liquids, vinous and spirituous, should cherish Bacon's sapient
deliverance: "It is like that the brain of man waxeth moister and fuller upon the full of
the moon; and therefore it were good for those that have moist brains, and are great
drinkers, to take sume of <i>lignum aloes</i>, rosemary, frankincense, etc., about the
full of the moon. It is like, also, that the humours in men's bodies increase and
decrease as the moon doth; and therefore it were good to purge some day or two after the
full; for that then the humours will not replenish so soon again."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note383"><u>[383]</u></a> All this sounds so unphilosophical that it is almost
incredible that the learned Bacon believed what he wrote. Darker superstitions,
however, still linger in our land. &quot;In Staffordshire, it is commonly said, if
you want to cure chin-cough, take out the child and let it look at the new moon;
lift up its clothes and rub your right hand up and down its stomach, and repeat
the following lines (looking steadfastly at the moon, and rubbing at the same
time):--</p>

<blockquote>
'What I see, may it increase;<br>
What I feel, may it decrease;
</blockquote>

<p>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note384"><u>[384]</u></a> There is a little ambiguity here. What is felt is the child's
stomach. But the desire is not that that may decrease, but only the whooping cough, which
is <i>felt</i>, we take it, by proxy. A lady, writing of the southern county of Sussex,
says: "A superstition lingering amongst us, worthy of the days of paganism, is that the
new May moon, aided by certain charms, has the power of curing scrofulous
complaints."&nbsp;<a href="#note385"><u>[385]</u></a></p>

<p>As the cutting of hair, finger-nails, and corns has some relation to health and
comfort, we may here mention that in Devonshire it is said that hair and nails should
always be cut in the waning of the moon, thereby beneficial consequences will result. If
corns are cut after the full moon, some say that they will gradually disappear. In the
<i>British Apollo</i> we have the following request for advice:</p>

<blockquote>
"Pray tell your querist if he may<br>
Rely on what the vulgar say,<br>
That when the moon's in her increase,<br>
If corns be cut they'll grow apace<br>
But if you always do take care<br>
After the full your corns to pare,<br>
They do insensibly decay<br>
And will in time wear quite away.<br>
If this be true, pray let me know,<br>
And give the reason why 'tis so."&nbsp;<a href="#note386"><u>[386]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The following passage is worth quoting, without any abbreviation, as an excellent
summary of wisdom and sense regarding the moon's influence on health: "There is much
reason for regarding the moon as a source of evil, yet not that she herself is so, but
only the circumstances which attend her. With us it happens that a bright moonlight night
is always a cold one. The absence of cloud allows the earth to radiate its heat into
space, and the air gradually cools, until the moisture it contained is precipitated in
the form of dew, and lies like a thick blanket on the ground to prevent a further
cooling. When the quantity of moisture in the air is small, the refrigerating process
continues until frost is produced, and many a moonlight night in spring destroys half or
even the whole of the fruit of a new season. Moonlight, therefore, frequently involves
the idea of frigidity. With us, whose climate is comparatively cold, the change from the
burning, blasting, or blighting heat of day, or sun-up, to the cold of a clear night, or
sun-down, is not very great, but within the tropics the change is enormous. To such
sudden vicissitudes in temperature, an Indian doctor, in whom I have great confidence,
attributes fevers and agues. As it is clear that those persons only, whose business or
pleasure obliges them to be out on cloudless nights, suffer from the severe cold produced
by the rapid radiation into space of the heat of their own bodies and that of the earth,
those who remain at home are not likely to suffer from the effects of the sudden and
continued chill. Still further, it is clear that people in general will not care to go
out during the darkness of a moonless night, unless obliged to do so. Consequently few
persons have experience of the deleterious influence of starlight nights. But when a
bright moon and a hot, close house induce the people to turn out and enjoy the coldness
and clearness of night, it is very probable that refrigeration may be followed by severe
bodily disease. Amongst such a people, the moon would rather be anathematised than
adored. One may enjoy half an hour, or perhaps an hour, of moonlight, and yet be blighted
or otherwise injured by a whole night of it."&nbsp;<a href="#note387"><u>[387]</u></a> In
Denmark a superstition is current concerning the noxious influences of night. The Danes
have a kind of elves which they call the "Moon Folk." "The man is like an old man with a
low-crowned hat upon his head; the woman is very beautiful in front, but behind she is
hollow, like a dough-trough, and she has a sort of harp on which she plays, and lures
young men with it, and then kills them. The man is also an evil being, for if any one
comes near him he opens his mouth and breathes upon them, and his breath causes sickness.
It is easy to see what this tradition means: it is the damp marsh wind, laden with foul
and dangerous odours; and the woman's harp is the wind playing across the marsh rushes at
nightfall."&nbsp;<a href="#note388"><u>[388]</u></a> It is the Queen of the Fairies in
the <i>Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> who says to the Fairy King,--</p>

<blockquote>
These are the forgeries of jealousy<br>
And never, since the middle summer's spring,<br>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<br>
By pav&egrave;d fountain, or by rushy brook,<br>
Or in the beach&egrave;d margent of the sea,<br>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.<br>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:<br>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br>
That rheumatic diseases do abound<br>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br>
From our debate, from our dissension<br>
We are their parents and original.
</blockquote>

<p>It will be thought rashly iconoclastic if we cast the least doubt upon the idea that
blindness is caused directly by the light of the moon. So many cases have been adduced
that it is considered a settled point. We, however, dare to dispute some of the evidence.
For instance "A poor man born in the village <i>Rowdil</i>, commonly called St.
Clement's, blind, lost his sight at every change of the moon, which obliged him to keep
his bed for a day or two, and then he recovered his sight."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note389"><u>[389]</u></a> If logic would enable us to prove a negative to this
statement, we would meet it with simple denial. But we have no hesitation in saying that
an investigation into this case would have exonerated the moon of any share in the
affliction, and have revealed some other and likely cause. Our chief objection to this
story is its element of periodicity; and we would require overwhelming testimony to
establish even the probability of such a miracle once a month. That permanent injury may
accrue to those whose sleeping eyes are exposed all night to the brightness of a full
moon is probable enough. But this would take place not because the moon's beams were
peculiarly baneful, but because any strong light would have a hurtful effect upon the
eyes when fixed for hours in the condition of sleep.</p>

<p>We can quite believe that in a dry atmosphere like that of Egypt, where ophthalmia is
very prevalent on account of constant irritation from the fine sand in the air, the eye,
weary with the heat and aridity of the day, would be impaired if uncovered in the air to
the rays of the moon. Carne's statements are consequently quite credible. He tells us:
"The effect of the moonlight on the eyes in this country is singularly injurious; the
natives tell you, as I found they also afterwards did in Arabia, always to cover your
eyes when you sleep in the open air. The moon here really strikes and affects the sight,
when you sleep exposed to it, much more than the sun; indeed, the sight of a person who
should sleep with his face exposed at night, would soon be utterly impaired or
destroyed."&nbsp;<a href="#note390"><u>[390]</u></a> For the same reason, that strong
light oppresses the slumbering eye, "the seaman in his hammock takes care not to face the
full moon, lest he be struck with blindness."&nbsp;<a href="#note391"><u>[391]</u></a>
Nor can we regard the following as "an <i>extraordinary</i> effect of moonlight upon the
human subject." In 1863, "a boy, thirteen years of age, residing near Peckham Rye, was
expelled his home by his mother for disobedience. He ran away to a cornfield close by,
and, on lying down in the open air, fell asleep. He slept throughout the night, which was
a moonlight one. Some labourers on their way to work, next morning, seeing the boy
apparently asleep, aroused him; the lad opened his eyes, but declared he could not see.
He was conveyed home, and medical advice was obtained; the surgeon affirmed that the
total loss of sight resulted from sleeping in the moonlight."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note392"><u>[392]</u></a> This was sad enough; but it was antecedently probable. No
doubt a boy of thirteen who for disobedience was cast out of home in such a place as
London had a hard lot, and went supperless to his open bed. His optic nerves were young
and sensitive, and the protracted light so paralysed them that the morning found them
closed "in endless night." This was a purely natural result: to admitting it, reason
opposes no demur. But we must object, for truth's sake, to the tendency to account for
natural consequences by assigning supernatural causes. The moon is no divinity; moonlight
is no Divine emanation, with a vindictive animus; and those who countenance such silly
superstition as that moonstroke is a mysterious, evil agency, are contributing to a
polytheism which leads to atheism: for many gods logically means no GOD at all.</p>

<p>Another branch of this umbrageous if not fructuous tree of lunar superstition
is the moon's influence on human fortune. Butler satirizes the visionary who--</p>

<blockquote>
"With the moon was more familiar<br>
Than e'er was almanac well-willer (compiler);<br>
Her secrets understood so clear<br>
That some believed he had been there;<br>
Knew when she was in fittest mood<br>
For cutting corns, or letting blood:<br>
Whether the wane be, or increase,<br>
Best to set garlick, or sow pease:<br>
Who first found out the man i' th' moon,<br>
That to the ancients was unknown.&quot;--<i>Hudibras</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>A Swiss theologian amusingly describes the superstitious person who reads his fortune
in the stars. He, it is said, "will be more afraid of the constellation fires than the
flames of his next neighbour's house. He will not open a vein till he has asked leave of
the planets. He will not commit his seed to the earth when the soil, but when the moon,
requires it. He will have his hair cut when the moon is either in <i>Leo</i>, that his
locks may stare like the lion's shag, or in <i>Aries</i>, that they may curl like a ram's
horn. Whatever he would have to grow, he sets about when she is in her increase; but for
what he would have made less, he chuses her wane. When the moon is in <i>Taurus</i>, he
never can be persuaded to take physic, lest that animal which chews its cud should make
him cast it up again. He will avoid the sea whenever <i>Mars</i> is in the midst of
heaven, lest that warrior-god should stir up pirates against him. In <i>Taurus</i> he
will plant his trees, that this sign, which the astrologers are pleased to call
<i>fixed</i>, may fasten them deep in the earth. If at any time he has a mind to be
admitted into the presence of a prince, he will wait till the moon is in conjunction with
the sun; for 'tis then the society of an inferior with a superior is salutary and
successful."&nbsp;<a href="#note393"><u>[393]</u></a></p>

<p>The <i>new moon</i> is considered pre-eminently auspicious for
commencements,--for all kinds of building up, and beginning <i>de novo</i>. Houses
are to be erected and moved into; marriages are to be concluded, money counted, hair and
nails cut, healing herbs and pure dew gathered, all at the new moon. Money counted at
that period will be increased. The <i>full moon</i> is the time for pulling down, and
thinking of the end of all things. Cut your timber, mow your grass, make your hay, not
while the sun shines, but while the moon wanes; also stuff your feather-bed then, and so
kill the newly plucked feathers completely, and bring them to rest. Wash your linen, too,
by the waning moon, that the dirt may disappear with the dwindling light.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note394"><u>[394]</u></a> According to one old notion it was deemed unlucky to assume a
new dress when the moon was in her decline. So says the Earl of Northampton: "They
forbidde us when the moone is in a fixed signe, to put on a newe garment. Why so? Because
it is lyke that it wyll be too longe in wearing, a small fault about this towne, where
garments seldome last till they be payd for. But thyr meaning is, that the garment shall
continue long, not in respect of any strength or goodness in the stuffe, but by the
durance or disease of him that hath neyther leysure nor liberty to weare
it."&nbsp;<a href="#note395"><u>[395]</u></a> It is well known that the ancient Hebrews
held the new moon in religious reverence. The trumpets were blown, solemn sacrifices were
offered and festivals held; and the first clay of the lunar month was always holy. In a
Talmudic compilation, to which Dr. Farrar has contributed a preface, we find an
interesting account of the <i>Blessing the new moon</i>. "It is a very pious act to bless
the moon at the close of the Sabbath, when one is dressed in his best attire and
perfumed. If the blessing is to be performed on the evening of an ordinary week-day, the
best dress is to be worn. According to the Kabbalists the blessings upon the moon are not
to be said till seven full days after her birth, but, according to later authorities,
this may be done after three days. The reason for not performing this monthly service
under a roof, but in the open air, is because it is considered as the reception of the
presence of the Shekinah, and it would not be respectful so to do anywhere but in the
open air. It depends very much upon circumstances when and where the new moon is to be
consecrated, and also upon one's own predisposition, for authorities differ. We will
close these remarks with the conclusion of the Kitzur Sh'lu on the subject, which, at p.
72, col. 2, runs thus:</p>

<p>"When about to sanctify the new moon, one should straighten his feet (as at the
Shemonah-esreh) and give one glance at the moon before he begins to repeat the ritual
blessing, and having commenced it he should not look at her at all. Thus should he
begin--'In the united name of the Holy and Blessed One' and His Shekinah, through
that Hidden and Consecrated One! and in the name of all Israel!' Then he is to proceed
with the 'Form of Prayer for the New Moon,' word for word, with out haste, but with
solemn deliberation, and when he repeats--</p>

<blockquote>
'Blessed is thy Former, Blessed is thy Maker,<br>
Blessed is thy Possessor, Blessed is thy Creator,'
</blockquote>

<p>he is to meditate on the initials of the four Divine epithets, which form 'Jacob'; for
the moon, which is called 'the lesser light,' is his emblem or symbol, and he is also
called 'little' (see Amos vii. 2). This he is to repeat three times. He is to skip three
times while repeating thrice the following sentence, and after repeating three times
forwards and backwards: thus (<i>forwards</i>)--'Fear and dread shall fall upon them
by the greatness of thine arm; they shall be as still as a stone'; thus
(<i>backwards</i>)--'Still as a stone may they be; by the greatness of thine arm may
fear and dread fall on them'; he then is to say to his neighbour three times, 'Peace be
unto you,' and the neighbour is to respond three times, 'Unto you be peace.' Then he is
to say three times (very loudly), 'David, the King of Israel, liveth and existeth!' and
finally, he is to say three times, 'May a good omen and good luck be upon us and upon all
Israel! Amen!'"&nbsp;<a href="#note396a"><u>[396a]</u></a></p>

<p>That the ancient Germans held the moon in similar regard we know from Caesar, who,
having inquired why Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, discovered this to be the
reason: "that among the Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from
lots and divination, whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or
not; that they had said, 'that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should
conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon.'"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note396b"><u>[396b]</u></a></p>

<p>Halliwell has reproduced an illustration of British superstition of the same sort. "A
very singular divination practised at the period of the harvest moon is thus described in
an old chap-book. When you go to bed, place under your pillow a prayer-book open at the
part of the matrimonial service 'with this ring I thee wed'; place on it a key, a ring, a
flower, and a sprig of willow, a small heart-cake, a crust of bread, and the following
cards:--the ten of clubs, nine of hearts, ace of spades, and the ace of
diamonds. Wrap all these in a thin handkerchief of gauze or muslin, and on
getting into bed, cross your hands, and say:--</p>

<blockquote>
'Luna, every woman's friend,<br>
To me thy goodness condescend<br>
Let me this night in vision see<br>
Emblems of my destiny.'
</blockquote>

<p>If you dream of storms, trouble will betide you; if the storm ends in a fine calm, so
will your fate; if of a ring or the ace of diamonds, marriage; bread, an industrious
life; cake, a prosperous life; flowers, joy; willow, treachery in love; spades, death;
diamonds, money; clubs, a foreign land; hearts, illegitimate children; keys, that you
will rise to great trust and power, and never know want; birds, that you will have many
children; and geese, that you will marry more than once."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note397"><u>[397]</u></a> Such ridiculous absurdities would be rejected as apocryphal
if young ladies were not still in the habit of placing bits of wedding cake under their
pillows in the hope that their dreaming eyes may be enchanted with blissful visions of
their future lords.</p>

<p>Hone tells us that in Berkshire, &quot;at the first appearance of a new moon,
maidens go into the fields, and, while they look at it, say:--</p>

<blockquote>
'New moon, new moon, I hail thee!<br>
By all the virtue in thy body.<br>
Grant this night that I may see<br>
He who my true love is to be.'
</blockquote>

<p>Then they return home, firmly believing that before morning their future husbands will
appear to them in their dreams."&nbsp;<a href="#note398"><u>[398]</u></a></p>

<p>In Devonshire also &quot;it is customary for young people, as soon as they see the
first new moon after midsummer, to go to a stile, turn their back to it, and
say:--</p>

<blockquote>
'All hail, new moon, all hail to thee!<br>
I prithe, good moon, reveal to me<br>
This night who shall my true love be<br>
Who is he, and what he wears,<br>
And what he does all months and years.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note399"><u>[399]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Aubrey says the same of the Scotch of his day, and the custom is not yet extinct. "In
Scotland (especially among the Highlanders) the women doe make a curtsey to the new moon;
I have known one in England doe it, and our English woemen in the country doe retain
(some of them) a touch of this gentilisme still, <i>e.g.</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>
'All haile to thee, moon, all haile to thee<br>
I prithe, good moon, declare to me,<br>
This night, who my husband must be.'
</blockquote>

<p>This they doe sitting astride on a gate or stile the first evening the new moon
appears. In Herefordshire, etc., the vulgar people at the prime of the moon say, '`Tis a
fine moon, God bless her.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note400"><u>[400]</u></a> &quot;In
Ireland, at the new moon, it is not an uncommon practice for people to point
with a knife, and after invoking the Holy Trinity, to say:--</p>

<blockquote>
'New moon, true morrow, be true now to me,<br>
That I ere the morrow my true love may see.'
</blockquote>

<p>The knife is then placed under the pillow, and silence strictly observed, lest the
charm should be broken."&nbsp;<a href="#note401"><u>[401]</u></a></p>

<p>Dr. Charles Mackay quotes from Mother Bridget's <i>Dream and Omen Book</i> the
following prescription for ascertaining the events of futurity. "<i>First new moon of the
year</i>. On the first new moon in the year take a pint of clear spring water, and infuse
into it the <i>white</i> of an egg laid by a <i>white</i> hen, a glass of <i>white</i>
wine, three almonds peeled <i>white</i>, and a tablespoonful of <i>white</i>
rose-water. Drink this on going to bed, not making more nor less than three
draughts of it; repeating the following verses three several times in a clear
distinct voice, but not so loud as to be overheard by anybody:--</p>

<blockquote>
'If I dream of water pure<br>
Before the coming morn,<br>
'Tis a sign I shall be poor,<br>
And unto wealth not born.<br>
If I dream of tasting beer,<br>
Middling, then, will be my cheer--<br>
Chequered with the good and bad,<br>
Sometimes joyful, sometimes sad;<br>
But should I dream of drinking wine,<br>
Wealth and pleasure will be mine.<br>
The stronger the drink, the better the cheer--<br>
Dreams of my destiny, appear, appear!'"&nbsp;<a href="#note402"><u>[402]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The day of the week on which the moon is new or full, is a question that awakens the
most anxious concern. In the north of Italy Wednesday is dreaded for a lunar change, and
in the south of France the inauspicious day is Friday.&nbsp;<a href=
"#note403"><u>[403]</u></a> In most of our own rural districts Friday's new moon is much
disliked</p>

<blockquote>
"Friday's moon,<br>
Come when it wool,<br>
It comes too soon."
</blockquote>

<p>Saturday is unlucky for the <i>new</i>, and Sunday for the <i>full</i> moon.
In Norfolk it is said:--</p>

<blockquote>
"Saturday's new and Sunday's full,<br>
Never was good, and never wull."
</blockquote>

<p>An apparently older version of the same weather-saw runs:--</p>

<blockquote>
"A Saturday's change, and a Sunday's prime,<br>
Was nivver a good mune in nea man's time."
</blockquote>

<p>In Worcestershire, a cottager near Berrow Hill told Mr. Edwin Lees, F.L.S., that as
the new moon had fallen on a Saturday, there would follow twenty-one days of wind or
rain; for</p>

<blockquote>
"If the moon on a Saturday be new or full,<br>
There always <i>was</i> rain, and there always <i>w&uuml;ll</i>."
</blockquote>

<p>One rustic rhyme rehearsed in some places is:--</p>

<blockquote>
"A Saturday moon,<br>
If it comes once in seven years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes once too soon."
</blockquote>

<p>Next to the day, the medium through which the new moon is first beheld, is of vital
moment. In Staffordshire it is unlucky to see this sight through trees. A correspondent
in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (21st January, 1882) once saw a person almost in tears
because she looked on the new moon through her veil, feeling convinced that misfortune
would follow. Henderson cites a canon to be observed by those who would know what year
they would wed. "Look at the first new moon of the year through a silk handkerchief which
has never been washed. As many moons as you see through the handkerchief (the threads
multiplying the vision), so many years will pass ere you are married."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note404"><u>[404]</u></a> Hunt tells us, what in fact is widely believed, that "to see
the new moon for the first time through glass, is unlucky; you may be certain that you
will break glass before that moon is out. I have known persons whose attention has been
called to a clear new moon hesitate. 'Hev I seed her out o' doors afore?' if not, they
will go into the open air, and, if possible, show the moon 'a piece of gold,' or, at all
events, turn their money."&nbsp;<a href="#note405"><u>[405]</u></a> Mrs. Latham says:
"Many of our Sussex superstitions are probably of Saxon origin; amongst which may be the
custom of bowing or curtseying to the new or Lady moon, as she is styled, to deprecate
bad luck. There is another kindred superstition, that the Queen of night will dart
malignant rays upon you, if on the first day of her re-appearance you look up to her
without money in your pocket. But if you are not fortunate enough to have any there, in
order to avert her evil aspect, you must immediately turn head over heels! It is
considered unlucky to see the new moon through a window-pane, and I have known a
maidservant shut her eyes when closing the shutters lest she should unexpectedly see it
through the glass. Do not kill your pig until full moon, or the pork will be
ruined."&nbsp;<a href="#note406"><u>[406]</u></a> In Suffolk, also, "it is considered
unlucky to kill a pig in the wane of the moon; if it is done, the pork will waste in
boiling. I have known the shrinking of bacon in the pot attributed to the fact of the pig
having been killed in the moon's decrease; and I have also known the death of poor piggy
delayed, or hastened, so as to happen during its increase."&nbsp;<a href=

<p>The desirability of possessing <i>silver</i> in the pocket, and of turning it over,
when the new moon is first seen, is a point of some interest. Forbes Leslie says, "The
ill-luck of having no <i>silver</i> money--coins of other metals being of no
avail--when you first see or hail a new moon, is still a common belief from Cornwall
to Caithness, as well as in Ireland."&nbsp;<a href="#note408"><u>[408]</u></a> And
Jamieson writes: "Another superstition, equally ridiculous and unaccountable, is still
regarded by some. They deem it very unlucky to see the new moon for the first time
without having <i>silver</i> in one's pocket. Copper is of no avail."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note409"><u>[409]</u></a> We venture to think that this is not altogether
unaccountable. The moon at night, in a clear sky, reflects a brilliant whiteness. The two
Hebrew words used of this luminary in the Bible, mean "pale light" and "white."
"Hindooism says that the moon, Soma, was turned into a female called Chandra--'the
White or Silvery One.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note410"><u>[410]</u></a> The Santhals of India
call the sun <i>Chando</i>, which means bright, and is also a name for the moon. Now pure
silver is of a very white colour and of a strong metallic lustre. It was one of the
earliest known metals, and used as money from the remotest times. Its whiteness led the
ancient astrologers, as it afterwards led the alchemists, to connect it with the moon,
and to call it Diana and Luna, names previously given to the satellite. For Artemis, the
Greek Diana, the Ephesian craftsmen made silver shrines. The moon became the symbol of
silver; and to this day fused nitrate of silver is called <i>lunar</i> caustic. It was
natural and easy for superstition to suppose that silver was the moon's own metal; and to
imagine that upon the reappearance of the lunar deity or demon, its beams should be
propitiated by some argentine possession. We find that silver was exclusively used in the
worship of the moon in Peru.</p>

<p>In a book published in the earlier part of last century, and attributed to Daniel
Defoe, we read; "To see a new moon the first time after her change, on the right hand, or
directly before you, betokens the utmost good fortune that month; as to have her on your
left, or behind you, so that in turning your head back you happen to see her, foreshows
the worst; as also, they say, to be without gold in your pocket at that time is of very
bad consequence."&nbsp;<a href="#note411"><u>[411]</u></a> The mistake in substituting
gold for silver here is easily explained. As among the Romans <i>aes</i> meant both
copper and money; and among the French <i>argent</i> means both silver and money in
general; so in England gold is the common expression for coin of any substance. Silver
being <i>money</i>, the word gold was thus substituted; the generic for the specific.
Other superstitions besides those above noticed are found in different parts of our
enlightened land. Denham says, "I once saw an aged matron turn her apron to the new moon
to insure good luck for the ensuing month."&nbsp;<a href="#note412"><u>[412]</u></a>
And Halliwell mentions a prayer customary among some persons:--</p>

<blockquote>
"I see the moon, and the moon sees me.<br>
God bless the moon, and God bless me."&nbsp;<a href="#note413"><u>[413]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>In Devonshire it is lucky to see the new moon over the right, but unlucky to see it
over the left shoulder; and to see it straight before is good fortune to the end of the
month. "In Renfrewshire, if a man's house be burnt during the wane of the moon, it is
deemed unlucky. If the same misfortune take place when the moon is waxing, it is viewed
as a presage of prosperity. In Orkney, also, it is reckoned unlucky to flit, or to remove
from one habitation to another, during the waning of the moon."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note414"><u>[414]</u></a> A recent writer tells us that in Orkney "there are
superstitions likewise associated with the moon. The increase, and full growth, and wane
of that satellite are the emblems of a rising, flourishing, and declining fortune. No
business of importance is begun during the moon's wane; if even an animal is killed at
that period, the flesh is supposed to be unwholesome. A couple to think of marrying at
that time would be regarded as recklessly careless respecting their future happiness Old
people in some parts of Argyllshire were wont to invoke the Divine blessing on the moon
after the monthly change. The Gaelic word for fortune is borrowed from that which denotes
the full moon; and a marriage or birth occurring at that period is believed to augur
prosperity."&nbsp;<a href="#note415"><u>[415]</u></a></p>

<p>Kirkmichael, says another writer on the Highlands of Scotland, hath "its due
proportion of that superstition which generally prevails over the Highlands. Unable to
account for the cause, they consider the effects of times and seasons as certain and
infallible. The moon in her increase, full growth, and in her wane, are with them the
emblems of a rising, flourishing, and declining fortune. At the last period of her
revolution they carefully avoid to engage in any business of importance; but the first
and the middle they seize with avidity, presaging the most auspicious issue to their
undertakings. Poor Martinus Scriblerus never more anxiously watched the blowing of the
west wind to secure an heir to his genius, than the love-sick swain and his nymph for the
coming of the new moon to be noosed together in matrimony. Should the planet happen to be
at the height of her splendour when the ceremony is performed, their future life will be
a scene of festivity, and all its paths strewed over with rosebuds of delight. But when
her tapering horns are turned towards the north, passion becomes frost-bound, and seldom
thaws till the genial season again approaches. From the moon they not only draw
prognostications of the weather, but according to their creed also discover future
events. There they are clearly portrayed, and ingenious illusion never fails in the
explanation. The veneration paid to this planet, and the opinion of its influences, are
obvious from the meaning still affixed to some words of the Gaelic language. In Druidic
mythology, when the circle of the moon was complete, fortune then promised to be most
propitious. Agreeably to this idea, <i>rath</i>, which signifies in Gaelic a wheel or
circle, is transferred to signify fortune."&nbsp;<a href="#note416"><u>[416]</u></a></p>

<p>Forbes Leslie writes: "The influence which the moon was supposed to exercise on
mankind, as well as on inanimate objects, may be traced in the practice of the Druids. It
is not yet extinct in Scotland; and the moon, in the increase, at the full, and on the
wane, are emblems of prosperity, established success, or declining fortune, by which many
persons did, and some still do, regulate the period for commencing their most important
undertakings."&nbsp;<a href="#note417"><u>[417]</u></a> And yet once more, to make the
induction most conclusive; we are told that "the canon law anxiously prohibited
observance of the moon as regulating the period of marriage; nor was any regard to be
paid to certain days of the year for ceremonies. If the Lucina of the ancients be
identified with Diana, it was not unreasonable to court the care of the parturient, by
selecting the time deemed most propitious. The strength of the ecclesiastical
interdiction does not seem to have prevailed much in Scotland. Friday, which was
consecrated to a northern divinity, has been deemed more favourable for the union. In the
southern districts of Scotland, and in the Orkney Islands, the inhabitants preferred the
increase of the moon for it. Auspicious circumstances were anticipated in other parts,
from its celebration at full moon. Good fortune depended so much on the increase of that
luminary, that nothing important was undertaken during its wane. Benefit even accrued to
the stores provided during its increase, and its effect in preserving them is still
credited."&nbsp;<a href="#note418"><u>[418]</u></a> To what, but to this prevalent belief
in lunar influence on fortune can Shakespeare allude, when Romeo swears:</p>

<blockquote>
"<i>Rom</i>. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,<br>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jul</i>. Oh, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,<br>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."&nbsp;<a href="#note419"><u>[419]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon the physiological influence of the lunar rays in the generation or aggravation of
disease, we have but little to add to what has been already written. It is a topic for a
special treatise, and properly belongs to those medical experts whose research and
practice in this particular branch of physics qualify them to speak with plenary
authority. Besides, it has been so wisely handled by Dr. Forbes Winslow, in his admirable
monograph on <i>Light</i>, that inquirers cannot follow a safer guide than his little
book affords. Dr. Winslow accounts for the theory of planetary influence partly by the
action of the moon in producing the tides. He says: "Astronomers having admitted that the
moon was capable of producing this physical effect upon the waters of the ocean, it was
not altogether unnatural that the notion should become not only a generally received but
a popular one, that the ebb and flow of the tides had a material influence over the
bodily functions. The Spaniards imagine that all who die of chronic diseases breathe
their last during the ebb. Southey says, that amongst the wonders of the isles and city
of Cadiz, which the historian of that city, Suares de Salazar, enumerates, one is,
according to p. Labat, that the sick never die there while the tide is rising or at its
height, but always during the ebb. He restricts the notion to the isle of Leon, but
implies that the effect was there believed to take place in diseases of all kinds, acute
as well as chronic. 'Him fever,' says the negro in the West Indies, 'shall go when the
water come low; him always come not when the tide high.' The popular notion amongst the
negroes appears to be that the ebb and flow of the tides are caused by a '<i>fever of the
sea</i>,' which rages for six hours, and then intermits for as many more."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note420"><u>[420]</u></a> Dr. Winslow then subjoins a long list of learned authorities,
several of whose writings he subjects to a brief analysis. He disapproves of the
presumption that the subject is altogether visionary and utopian; and affirms that it has
not always been pursued by competent observers. Periodicity is noted as an important
symptom in disease; a feature in febrile disturbance which the present writer himself had
abundant opportunity of marking and measuring during an epidemic of yellow fever in the
city of Savannah in the year 1876. This periodicity Dr. Winslow regards as the foundation
of the alleged lunar influence in morbid conditions. Some remarkable cases are referred
to, which, if the fact of the moon's interference with human functions could be admitted,
would go a long way to corroborate and confirm it. The supposed influence of the moon on
plants is not passed over, nor the chemical composition of lunar light as a possible evil
agency. Still considering the matter <i>sub judice</i>, Dr. Winslow then proceeds to the
alleged influence of the moon on the insane; a question with which he was pre-eminently
competent to cope. After alluding to the support given to the popular belief by poets and
philosophers of ancient and modern times, the question of periodicity, or "lucid
intervals," is again discussed, this time in its mental aspect, and the hygienic or
sanatory influence of light is allowed its meed of consideration. The final result of the
investigation is that the matter is held to be purely speculative, and it is esteemed
wise to hold in reserve any theory in relation to the subject that may have been formed.
With this conclusion we are greatly disappointed. Dr. Winslow's aid in the inquiry is
most valuable, and if he, after his careful review of pathological literature on lunar
influence, coupled with his own extended experience, holds the question in abeyance, who
will venture upon a decision? We however believe, notwithstanding every existing
difficulty, that the subject will be brought into clear light ere long, and all
superstition end in accurate science. Meanwhile, many, even of the enlightened, will
cling to the unforgotten fancy which gave rise to the word <i>lunatic</i>, and in cases
of mental derangement will moralize with young Banks in the <i>Witch of Edmonton</i>
(1658), "When the moon's in the full, then wit's in the wane."</p><br>

<center>
<a name="IV" id="IV"></a>MOON INHABITATION.
</center>

<p>Science having practically diminished the moon's distance, and rendered distinct its
elevations and depressions, it is natural for "those obstinate questionings of sense and
outward things" to urge the inquiry, <i>Is the moon inhabited</i>? This question it is
easier to ask than to answer. It has been a mooted point for many years, and our wise men
of the west seem still disposed to give it up, or, at least, to adjourn its decision for
want of evidence. Of "guesses at truth" there have been a great multitude, and of
dogmatic assertions not a few; but demonstrations are things which do not yet appear. We
now take leave to report progress, and give the subject a little ventilation. We do not
expect to furnish an Ariadne's thread, but we may hope to find some indication of the
right way out of this labyrinth of uncertainty. <i>Veritas nihil veretur nisi
abscondi</i>: or, as the German proverb says, "Truth creeps not into corners"; its life
is the light.</p>

<p>But before we advance a single step, we desire to preclude all misunderstanding on one
point, by distinctly avowing our conviction that the teachings of Christian theology are
not at all involved in the issue of this discussion, whatever it may prove. Infinite harm
has been done by confusing the religion of science with the science of religion. Religion
<i>is</i> a science, and science is a religion; but they are not identical. Philosophy
ought to be pious, and piety ought to be philosophical; but philosophy and piety are two
quantities and qualities that may dwell apart, though, happily, they may also be found in
one nature. Each has its own faculties and functions; and in our present investigation,
religion has nothing more to do than to shed the influence of reverence, humility, and
teachableness over the scientific student as he ponders his problem and works out the
truth. In this, and in kindred studies, we may yield without reluctance what a certain
professor of religion concedes, and grant without grudging what a certain professor of
science demands. Dr. James Martineau says, "In so far as Church belief is still committed
to a given kosmogony and natural history of man, it lies open to scientific refutation";
and again, "The whole history of the Genesis of things Religion must unconditionally
surrender to the Sciences."&nbsp;<a href="#note421"><u>[421]</u></a> In this we willingly
concur, for science ought to be, and will be, supreme in its own domain. Bishop Temple
does "not hesitate to ascribe to Science a clearer knowledge of the true interpretation
of the first chapter of Genesis, and to scientific history a truer knowledge of the great
historical prophets. Science enters into Religion, and the believer is bound to recognise
its value and make use of its services."&nbsp;<a href="#note422"><u>[422]</u></a> Then,
to quote the professor of science, Dr. John Tyndall says. "The impregnable position of
science may be described in a few words. We claim, and we shall wrest from Theology, the
entire domain of cosmological theory."&nbsp;<a href="#note423"><u>[423]</u></a> We wish
the eloquent professor all success. It was not the spirit of primitive Christianity, but
the spirit of priestly ignorance, intolerance, and despotism, which invaded the territory
of natural science; and if those who are its rightful lords can recover the soil, we bid
them heartily, God speed! We have been driven to these remarks by a twofold impulse.
First, we can never forget the injury that has been inflicted on science by the
oppositions of a headless religion; any more than we can forget the injury which has been
inflicted on religion by the oppositions of a heartless science. Secondly, we have seen
this very question of the inhabitation of the planets and satellites rendered a topic of
ridicule for Thomas Paine, and an inviting theme for raillery to others of sophistical
spirit, by the way in which it has been foolishly mixed up with sacred or spiritual
concerns. Surely, the object of God in the creation of our terrestrial race, or the
benefits of the death of Jesus Christ, can have no more to do with the habitability of
the moon, than the doctrine of the Trinity has to do with the multiplication table and
the rule of three, or the hypostatical union with the chemical composition of water and
light. Having said thus much of compulsion, we return, not as ministers in the temple of
religion so much as students in the school of science, to consider with docility the
question in dispute, <i>Is the moon inhabited</i>?</p>

<p>Three avenues, more or less umbrageous, are open to us; all of which have been
entered. They may be named <i>observation</i>, <i>induction</i>, and <i>analogy</i>. The
first, if we could pursue it, would explicate the enigma at once. The second, if clear,
would satisfy our reason, which, in such a matter, might be equivalent to sight. And the
third might conduct us to a shadow which would "prove the substance true." We begin by
dealing briefly with the argument from <i>observation</i>. Here our data are small and
our difficulties great. One considerable inconvenience in the inquiry is, of course, the
moon's distance. Though she is our next-door neighbour in the many-mansioned universe,
two hundred and thirty-seven thousand miles are no mere step heavenward. Transit across
the intervenient space being at present impracticable, we have to derive our most
enlarged views of this "spotty globe" from the "optic glass." But this admirable
appliance, much as it has revealed, is thus far wholly inadequate to the solution of our
mystery. Robert Hooke, in the seventeenth century, thought that he could construct a
telescope with which we might discern the inhabitants of the moon life-size--seeing
them as plainly as we see the inhabitants of the earth. But, alas! the sanguine
mathematician died in his sleep, and his dream has not yet come true. Since Hooke's day
gigantic instruments have been fitted up, furnished with all the modern improvements
which could be supplied through the genius or generosity of such astronomers as Joseph
Fraunhofer and Sir William Herschel, the third Earl of Rosse and the fourth Duke of
Northumberland. But all of these worthy men left something to be done by their
successors. Consequently, not long since, our scientists set to work to increase their
artificial eyesight. The Rev. Mr. Webb tells us that "the first 'Moon Committee' of the
British Association recommended a power of 1,000." But he discourages us if we anticipate
large returns; for he adds: "Few indeed are the instruments or the nights that will bear
it; but when employed, what will be the result? Since increase of magnifying is
equivalent to decrease of distance, we shall see the moon as large (though not as
distinct) as if it were 240 miles off, and any one can judge what could be made of the
grandest building upon earth at that distance."&nbsp;<a href="#note424"><u>[424]</u></a>
If therefore we are to see the settlement of the matter in the speculum of a telescope,
it may be some time before we have done with what Guillemin calls "the interesting,
almost insoluble question, of the existence of living and organized beings on the surface
of the satellite of our little earth."&nbsp;<a href="#note425"><u>[425]</u></a>
Some cynic may interpose with the quotation,--</p>

<blockquote>
"But optics sharp it needs, I ween,<br>
To see what is not to be seen."&nbsp;<a href="#note426"><u>[426]</u></a>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but it remains to be shown that there is nothing to be seen beyond what
<i>we</i> see. We are not prepared to deny the existence of everything which our mortal
eyes may fail to trace. Four hundred years ago all Europe believed that to sail in search
of a western continent was to wish "to see what is not to be seen"; but a certain
Christopher Columbus went out persuaded of things not seen as yet, and having embarked in
faith he landed in sight. The lesson must not be lost upon us.</p>

<blockquote>
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
</blockquote>

<p>Because we cannot now make out either habitations or habitants on the moon, it does
not necessarily follow that the night will never come when, through some mightier medium
than any ever yet constructed or conceived, we shall descry, beside mountains and
valleys, also peopled plains and populous cities animating the fair features of this
beautiful orb. One valuable auxiliary of the telescope, destined to play an important
part in lunar discovery, must not be overlooked. Mr. Norman Lockyer says, "With reference
to the moon, if we wish to map her correctly, it is now no longer necessary to depend on
ordinary eye observations alone; it is perfectly clear that by means of an image of the
moon, taken by photography, we are able to fix many points on the lunar
surface."&nbsp;<a href="#note427"><u>[427]</u></a> With telescopic and photographic
lenses in skilled hands, and a wealth of inventive genius in fertile brains, we can
afford to wait a long while before we close the debate with a final negative.</p>

<p>In the meantime, eyes and glasses giving us no satisfaction, we turn to scientific
<i>induction</i>. Speculation is a kind of mental mirror, that before now has anticipated
or supplemented the visions of sense. Not being practical astronomers ourselves, we have
to follow the counsel of that unknown authority who bids us believe the expert. But
expertness being the fruit of experience, we may be puzzled to tell who have attained
that rank. We will inquire, however, with due docility, of the oracles of scientific
research. It is agreed on all sides that to render the moon habitable by beings at all
akin with our own kind, there must be within or upon that body an atmosphere, water,
changing seasons, and the alternations of day and night. We know that changes occur in
the moon, from cold to heat, and from darkness to light. But the lunar day is as long as
291 of ours; so that each portion of the surface is exposed to, or turned from, the sun
for nearly 14 days. This long exposure produces excessive heat, and the long darkness
excessive cold. Such extremities of temperature are unfavourable to the existence of
beings at all like those living upon the earth, especially if the moon be without water
and atmosphere. As these two desiderata seem indispensable to lunar inhabitation, we may
chiefly consider the question, Do these conditions exist? If so, inductive reasoning will
lead us to the inference, which subsequent experience will strengthen, that the moon is
inhabited like its superior planet. But if not, life on the satellite similar to life on
the earth, is altogether improbable, if not absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>The replies given to this query will be by no means unanimous. But, for the full
understanding of the state of the main question, and to assist us in arriving at some
sort of verdict, we will hear several authorities on both sides of the case. The evidence
being cumulative, we pursue the chronological order, and begin with La Place. He writes:
"The lunar atmosphere, if any such exists, is of an extreme rarity, greater even than
that which can be produced on the surface of the earth by the best constructed air-pumps.
It may be inferred from this that no terrestrial animal could live or respire at the
surface of the moon, and that if the moon be inhabited, it must be by animals of another
species."&nbsp;<a href="#note428"><u>[428]</u></a> This opinion, as Sir David Brewster
points out, is not that the moon has no atmosphere, but that if it have any it is
extremely attenuated. Mr. Russell Hind's opinion is similar with respect to water. He
says: "Earlier selenographists considered the dull, grayish spots to be water, and termed
them the lunar seas, bays, and lakes. They arc so called to the present day, though we
have strong evidence to show that if water exist at all on the moon, it must be in very
small quantity."&nbsp;<a href="#note429"><u>[429]</u></a> Mr. Grant tells us that "the
question whether the moon be surrounded by an atmosphere has been much discussed by
astronomers. Various phenomena are capable of indicating such an atmosphere, but,
generally speaking, they are found to be unfavourable to its existence, or at all events
they lead to the conclusion that it must be very inconsiderable."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note430"><u>[430]</u></a> Humboldt thinks that Schroeter's assumptions of a lunar
atmosphere and lunar twilight are refuted, and adds: "If, then, the moon is without any
gaseous envelope, the entire absence of any diffused light must cause the heavenly
bodies, as seen from thence, to appear projected against a sky <i>almost black</i> in the
day-time. No undulation of air can there convey sound, song, or speech. The moon, to our
imagination, which loves to soar into regions inaccessible to full research, is a desert
where silence reigns unbroken."&nbsp;<a href="#note431"><u>[431]</u></a> Dr. Lardner
considers it proven "that there does not exist upon the moon an atmosphere capable of
reflecting light in any sensible degree," and also believes that "the same physical tests
which show the non-existence of an atmosphere of air upon the moon are equally conclusive
against an atmosphere of vapour."&nbsp;<a href="#note432"><u>[432]</u></a> Mr. Breen is
more emphatic. He writes: "In the want of water and air, the question as to whether this
body is inhabited is no longer equivocal. Its surface resolves itself into a sterile and
inhospitable waste, where the lichen which flourishes amidst the frosts and snows of
Lapland would quickly wither and die, and where no animal with a drop of blood in its
veins could exist."&nbsp;<a href="#note433"><u>[433]</u></a> The anonymous author of the
Essay on the <i>Plurality of Worlds</i> announces that astronomers are agreed to negative
our question without dissent. We shall have to manifest his mistake. His words are: "Now
this minute examination of the moon's surface being possible, and having been made by
many careful and skilful astronomers, what is the conviction which has been conveyed to
their minds with regard to the fact of her being the seat of vegetable or animal life?
Without exception, it would seem, they have all been led to the belief that the moon is
not inhabited; that she is, so far as life and organization are concerned, waste and
barren, like the streams of lava or of volcanic ashes on the earth, before any vestige of
vegetation has been impressed upon them; or like the sands of Africa, where no blade of
grass finds root."&nbsp;<a href="#note434"><u>[434]</u></a> Robert Chambers says: "It
does not appear that our satellite is provided with an atmosphere of the kind found upon
earth; neither is there any appearance of water upon the surface. . . . These
characteristics of the moon forbid the idea that it can be at present a theatre of life
like the earth, and almost seem to declare that it never can become so."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note435"><u>[435]</u></a> Schoedler's opinion is concurrent with what has preceded. He
writes: "According to the most exact observations it appears that the moon has no
atmosphere similar to ours, that on its surface there are no great bodies of water like
our seas and oceans, so that the existence of water is doubtful. The whole physical
condition of the lunar surface must, therefore, be so different from that of our earth,
that beings organized as we are could not exist there."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note436"><u>[436]</u></a> Another German author says: "The observations of Fraunhofer
(1823), Brewster and Gladstone (1860), Huggins and Miller, as well as Janssen, agree in
establishing the complete accordance of the lunar spectrum with that of the sun. In all
the various portions of the moon's disk brought under observation, no difference could be
perceived in the dark lines of the spectrum, either in respect of their number or
relative intensity. From this entire absence of any special absorption lines, it must be
concluded that there is no atmosphere in the moon, a conclusion previously arrived at
from the circumstance that during an occultation no refraction is perceived on the moon's
limb when a star disappears behind the disk."&nbsp;<a href="#note437"><u>[437]</u></a>
Mr. Nasmyth follows in the same strain. Holding that the moon lacks air, moisture, and
temperature, he says, "Taking all these adverse conditions into consideration, we are in
every respect justified in concluding that there is no possibility of animal or vegetable
life existing on the moon, and that our satellite must therefore be regarded as a barren
world."&nbsp;<a href="#note438"><u>[438]</u></a> A French astronomer holds a like
opinion, saying: "There is nothing to show that the moon possesses an atmosphere; and if
there was one, it would be perceptible during the occultations of the stars and the
eclipses of the sun. It seems impossible that, in the complete absence of air, the moon
can be peopled by beings organized like ourselves, nor is there any sign of vegetation or
of any alteration in the state of its surface which can be attributed to a change of
seasons."&nbsp;<a href="#note439"><u>[439]</u></a> On the same side Mr. Crampton writes
most decisively, "With what we <i>do</i> know, however, of our satellite, I think the
idea of her being inhabited may be dismissed <i>summarily</i>; <i>i.e.</i> her
inhabitation by intelligent beings, or an animal creation such as exist
here."&nbsp;<a href="#note440"><u>[440]</u></a> And, finally, in one of Maunder's
excellent <i>Treasuries</i>, we read of the moon, "She has no atmosphere, or at least
none of sufficient density to refract the rays of light as they pass through it, and
hence there is no water on her surface; consequently she can have no animals like those
on our planet, no vegetation, nor any change of seasons."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note441"><u>[441]</u></a> These opinions, recorded by so many judges of approved
ability and learning, have great weight; and some may regard their premisses and
conclusions as irresistibly cogent and convincing. The case against inhabitation is
certainly strong. But justice is impartial. <i>Audi alteram partem</i>.</p>

<p>Judges of equal erudition will now speak as respondents. We go back to the seventeenth
century, and begin with a work whose reasoning is really remarkable, seeing that it is
nearly two hundred and fifty years since it was first published. We refer to the
<i>Discovery of a New World</i> by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester; in which the reverend
philosopher aims to prove the following propositions:--"1. That the strangeness of
this opinion (that the moon may be a world) is no sufficient reason why it should be
rejected; because other certain truths have been formerly esteemed as ridiculous, and
great absurdities entertained by common consent. 2. That a plurality of worlds does not
contradict any principle of reason or faith. 3. That the heavens do not consist of any
such pure matter which can privilege them from the like change and corruption, as these
inferior bodies are liable unto. 4. That the moon is a solid, compacted, opacous body. 5.
That the moon hath not any light of her own. 6. That there is a world in the moon, hath
been the direct opinion of many ancient, with some modern mathematicians; and may
probably be deduced from the tenets of others. 9. That there are high mountains, deep
valleys, and spacious plains in the body of the moon. 10. That there is an atmosphoera,
or an orb of gross vaporous air, immediately encompassing the body of the moon. 13. That
'tis probable there may be inhabitants in this other world; but of what kind they are, is
uncertain."&nbsp;<a href="#note442"><u>[442]</u></a> We go on to 1686, and listen to the
French philosopher, Fontenelle, in his Conversations with the Marchioness. "'Well,
madam,' <i>said I</i>, 'you will not be surprised when you hear that the moon is an earth
too, and that she is inhabited as ours is.' 'I confess,' <i>said she</i>, 'I have often
heard talk of the world in the moon, but I always looked upon it as visionary and mere
fancy.' 'And it may be so still,' <i>said I</i>. 'I am in this case as people in a civil
war, where the uncertainty of what may happen makes them hold intelligence with the
opposite party; for though I verily believe the moon is inhabited, I live civilly with
those who do not believe it; and I am still ready to embrace the prevailing opinion. But
till the unbelievers have a more considerable advantage, I am for the people in the
moon.'"&nbsp;<a href="#note443"><u>[443]</u></a> Whatever may be thought of his
philosophy, no one could quarrel with the Secretary of the Academy on the score of his
politeness or his prudence. A more recent and more reliable authority appears in Sir
David Brewster. He tells us that "MM. M&auml;dler and Beer, who have studied the moon's
surface more diligently than any of their predecessors or contemporaries, have arrived at
the conclusion that she has an atmosphere." Sir David himself maintains that "<i>every
planet and satellite in the solar system must have an atmosphere</i>."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note444"><u>[444]</u></a> Bonnycastle, whilom professor of mathematics in the Royal
Military Academy, Woolwich, writes: "Astronomers were formerly of opinion that the moon
had no atmosphere, on account of her never being obscured by clouds or vapours; and
because the fixed stars, at the time of an occultation, disappear behind her
instantaneously, without any gradual diminution of their light. But if we consider the
effects of her days and nights, which are near thirty times as long as with us, it may be
readily conceived that the phenomena of vapours and meteors must be very different. And
besides, the vaporous or obscure part of our atmosphere is only about the one thousand
nine hundred and eightieth part of the earth's diameter, as is evident from observing the
clouds, which are seldom above three or four miles high; and therefore, as the moon's
apparent diameter is only about thirty-one minutes and a half, or one thousand eight
hundred and ninety seconds, the obscure part of her atmosphere, supposing it to resemble
our own, when viewed from the earth, must subtend an angle of less than one second; which
is so small a space, that observations must be extremely accurate to determine whether
the supposed obscuration takes place or not."&nbsp;<a href="#note445"><u>[445]</u></a>
Dr. Brinkley, at one time the Astronomer-Royal of Ireland, writes: "Many astronomers
formerly denied the existence of an atmosphere at the moon; principally from observing no
variation of appearance on the surface, like what would take place, did clouds exist as
with us; and also, from observing no change in the light of the fixed stars on the
approach of the dark edge of the moon. The circumstance of there being no clouds, proves
either that there is no atmosphere similar to that of our earth, or that there are no
waters on its surface to be converted into vapour; and that of the lustre of the stars
not being changed, proves that there can be no dense atmosphere. But astronomers now seem
agreed that an atmosphere does surround the moon, although of small density when compared
with that of our earth. M. Schroeter has observed a small twilight in the moon, such as
would arise from an atmosphere capable of reflecting the rays at the height of about one
mile."&nbsp;<a href="#note446"><u>[446]</u></a> Dr. Brinkley is inaccurate in saying that
astronomers are agreed as to the lunar atmosphere. Like students in every other
department of inquiry, spiritual as well as physical, they fail at present to see "eye to
eye"; which is not surprising, seeing that the eye is so restricted, and the object so
remote.</p>

<p>Dr. Dick, whose productions have done much to popularize the study of the heavens, and
to promote its reverent pursuit, says: "On the whole it appears most probable that the
moon is surrounded with a fluid which serves the purpose of an atmosphere; although this
atmosphere, as to its nature, composition, and refractive power, may be very different
from the atmosphere which surrounds the earth. It forms no proof that the moon, or any of
the planets, is destitute of an atmosphere, because its constitution, its density, and
its power of refracting the rays of light are different from ours. An atmosphere may
surround a planetary body, and yet its parts be so fine and transparent that the rays of
light, from a star or any other body, may pass through it without being in the least
obscured, or changing their direction. In our reasonings on this subject, we too
frequently proceed on the false principle, that everything connected with other worlds
must bear a resemblance to those on the earth."&nbsp;<a href="#note447"><u>[447]</u></a>
Mr. Neison, who has written one of the latest contributions to the science of
selenography, says, "Of the present non-existence of masses of water upon the surface of
the moon, there remains no doubt, though no evidence of its entire absence from the lunar
crust can be adduced; and similarly, many well-established facts in reference to the moon
afford ample proof of the non-existence of a lunar atmosphere, having a density equal to,
or even much less than, that of the earth; but of the absence of an atmosphere, whose
mass should enable it to play an important part in the moulding of the surface of the
moon, and comparable almost to that of the terrestrial atmosphere, in their respective
ratios to the masses of their planets, little, if any, trustworthy evidence exists." On
another page of the same work, the author affirms "that later inquiries have shown that
the moon may possess an atmosphere that must be regarded as fully capable of sustaining
various forms of vegetation of even an advanced type; and, moreover, it does not appear
how it can justly be questioned that the lunar surface in favourable positions may yet
retain a sufficiency of moisture to support vegetation of many kinds; whilst in a very
considerable portion of the entire surface of the moon, the temperature would not vary
sufficiently to materially affect the existence of vegetable life."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note448"><u>[448]</u></a> Some of these writers may appear to be travelling rather too
fast or too far, and their assumptions may wear more of the aspect of plausibility than
of probability. But on their atmospheric and aqueous hypothesis, vegetation in abundance
is confessedly a legitimate consequence. If a recent writer has liberty to condense into
a sentence the conclusion from the negative premiss in the argument by saying, "As there
is but a little appearance of water or air upon the moon, the conclusion has been
inferred that there exists no vegetable or animal life on that globe,"&nbsp;<a href=
"#note449"><u>[449]</u></a> other writers, holding opposite views of the moon's physical
condition, may be allowed to expatiate on the luxuriant life which an atmosphere with
water and temperature would undoubtedly produce. Mr. Proctor's tone is temperate, and his
language that of one who is conscious with Hippocrates that "art is long and life is
short." He says, in one of his contributions to lunar science, "It may safely be asserted
that the opportunities presented during the life of any single astronomer for a
trustworthy investigation of any portion of the moon's surface, under like conditions,
are few and far between, and the whole time so employed must be brief, even though the
astronomer devote many more years than usual to observational research."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note450"><u>[450]</u></a> This prepares us to find in another of the same author's
works the following suggestive sentence: "With regard to the present habitability of the
moon, it may be remarked that we are not justified in asserting positively that no life
exists upon her surface. Life has been found under conditions so strange, we have been so
often mistaken in assuming that <i>here</i> certainly, or <i>there</i>, no living
creatures can possibly exist, that it would be rash indeed to dogmatise respecting the
state of the moon in this respect."&nbsp;<a href="#note451"><u>[451]</u></a> Narrien, one
of the historians of the science, may be heard, though his contribution might be cast
into either scale. He writes: "The absence of those variations of light and shade which
would be produced by clouds floating above her surface, and the irregularities of the
ground, visible at the bottom and on the sides of her cavities, have given reason to
believe that no atmosphere surrounds her, and that she is destitute of rivers and seas.
Such are the opinions generally entertained concerning the moon; but M. Schroeter, a
German astronomer, ventures to assert that our satellite is the abode of living and
intellectual beings; he has perceived some indications of an atmosphere which, however,
he admits, cannot exceed two miles in height, and certain elevations which appear to him
to be works of art rather than of nature. He considers that a uniformity of temperature
must be produced on her surface by her slow rotation on her axis, by the insensible
change from day to night, and the attenuated state of her atmosphere, which is never
disturbed by storms; and that light vapours, rising from her valleys, fall in the manner
of a gentle and refreshing dew to fertilize her fields."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note452"><u>[452]</u></a> Dr. H. W. M. Olbers is fully persuaded "that the moon is
inhabited by rational creatures, and that its surface is more or less covered with a
vegetation not very dissimilar to that of our own earth." Dr. Gruithuisen, of Munich,
maintains that he has descried through his large achromatic telescope "great artificial
works in the moon erected by the lunarians," which he considers to be "a system of
fortifications thrown up by the selenitic engineers." We should have scant hope of
deciding the dispute by the dicta of the ancients, were these far more copious than we
find them to be. Yet reverence for antiquity may justify our quoting one of the classic
fathers. Plutarch says, "The Pythagoreans affirme, that the moone appeereth terrestriall,
for that she is inhabited round about, like as the earth wherein we are, and peopled as
it were with the greatest living creatures, and the fairest plants." Again, "And of all
this that hath been said (my friend <i>Theon</i>) there is nothing that doth proove and
show directly, this habitation of men in the moon to be impossible."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note453"><u>[453]</u></a> Here we close the argument based on <i>induction</i>, and sum
up the evidence in our possession. On the one hand, several scientific men, whose names
we need not repeat, having surveyed the moon, deny it an atmosphere, water, and other
conditions of life. Consequently, they disbelieve in its inhabitation, solely because
they consider the fact undemonstrable; none of them being so unscientific as to believe
it to be absolutely impossible. On the other hand, we have the valuable views of
M&auml;dler and Beer, whose lunar labours are unsurpassed, and whose map of the moon is a
marvel and model of advanced selenography. They do not suppose the conditions on our
satellite to be exactly what they are on this globe. In their own words, the moon is "no
copy of the earth, much less a colony of the same." They merely believe her to be
environed with air, and thus habitable. And when we recall our own Sir David Brewster,
Professor Bonnycastle, Dr. Brinkley, Dr. Dick, Mr. Neison, and Mr. Proctor; and reckon
with them the continental astronomers, Dr. Gruithuisen, Dr. Olbers, and Schroeter, all of
whom attempted to fix the idea of planetary inhabitation on the popular mind, we must
acknowledge that they, with their opponents, have a strong claim on our attention. The
only verdict we are able just now to render, after hearing these conflicting testimonies,
is the Scotch one, <i>Not proven</i>. We but append the legal indorsement
<i>ignoramus</i>, we do not know. The subject must remain <i>sub judice</i>; but what we
know not now, we hope to know hereafter.</p>

<p>Having interrogated <i>sense</i> and <i>science</i>, with the solution of our enigma
anything but complete, we resort last of all to the argument from <i>analogy</i>. If this
can illumine the obscurity, it will all be on the positive side of the inquiry. At
present the question resembles a half-moon: analogy may show that the affirmative is
waxing towards a full-orbed conviction. We open with Huyghens, a Dutch astronomer of
note, who, while he thinks it certain "that the moon has no air or atmosphere surrounding
it as we have," and "cannot imagine how any plants or animals whose whole nourishment
comes from fluid bodies, can thrive in a dry, waterless, parched soil," yet asks, "What,
then, shall this great ball be made for; nothing but to give us a little weak light in
the night time, or to raise our tides in the sea? Shall not we plant some people there
that may have the pleasure of seeing our earth turn upon its axis, presenting them
sometimes with a prospect of Europe and Africa, and then of Asia and America; sometimes
half and sometimes full?"&nbsp;<a href="#note454"><u>[454]</u></a> Ray was "persuaded
that this luminary doth serve many ends and uses, especially to maintain the creatures
which in all likelihood breed and inhabit there."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note455"><u>[455]</u></a> Swedenborg's <i>ipse dixit</i> ought to convince the most
incredulous; for he speaks "from what has been heard and seen." Thus he says: "That there
are inhabitants in the moon is well known to spirits and angels, and in like manner that
there are inhabitants in the moons or satellites which revolve about Jupiter and Saturn.
They who have not seen and discoursed with spirits coming from those moons still
entertain no doubt but there are men inhabiting them, because they are earths alike with
the planets, and wherever an earth is, there are men inhabitants; for man is the end for
which every earth was created, and nothing was made by the great Creator without an
end."&nbsp;<a href="#note456"><u>[456]</u></a> If any are still sceptical, Sir William
Herschel, an intellectual light of no mean magnitude, may reach them. He writes: "While
man walks upon the ground, the birds fly in the air, and fishes swim in water, we can
certainly not object to the conveniences afforded by the moon, if those that are to
inhabit its regions are fitted to their conditions as well as we on this globe arc to
ours. An absolute or total sameness seems rather to denote imperfections, such as nature
never exposes to our view; and, on this account, I believe the analogies that have been
mentioned fully sufficient to establish the high probability of the moon's being
inhabited like the earth."&nbsp;<a href="#note457"><u>[457]</u></a> The voice of Dr.
Dwight, the American theologian, will not be out of harmony here. In discoursing of the
starry heavens, he says of the planets: "Of these inferior worlds, the moon is one; and
to us, far the most interesting. How many important purposes which are known does this
beautiful attendant of our earth continually accomplish! How many more, in all
probability, which are hitherto unknown, and which hereafter may be extensively disclosed
to more enlightened, virtuous, and happy generations of men! At the same time, it is most
rationally concluded that intelligent beings in great multitudes inhabit her lucid
regions, being far better and happier than ourselves."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note458"><u>[458]</u></a> Whewell's <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i> will furnish us a
fitting quotation. "The earth, the globular body thus covered with life, is not the only
globe in the universe. There are, circling about our own sun, six others, so far as we
can judge, perfectly analogous in their nature: besides our moon and other bodies
analogous to it. No one can resist the temptation to conjecture, that these globes, some
of them much larger than our own, are not dead and barren:--that they are, like
ours, occupied with organization, life, intelligence."&nbsp;<a href=
"#note459"><u>[459]</u></a> In a most eloquent passage, Dr. Chalmers, who will always be
heard with admiration, exclaims: "Who shall assign a limit to the discoveries of future
ages? Who shall prescribe to science her boundaries, or restrain the active and
insatiable curiosity of man within the circle of his present acquirements? We may guess
with plausibility what we cannot anticipate with confidence. The day may yet be coming
when our instruments of observation shall be inconceivably more powerful. They may
ascertain still more decisive points of resemblance. They may resolve the same question
by the evidence of sense which is now so abundantly convincing by the evidence of
analogy. They may lay open to us the unquestionable vestiges of art, and industry, and
intelligence. We may see summer throwing its green mantle over those mighty tracts, and
we may see them left naked and colourless after the flush of vegetation has disappeared.
In the progress of years or of centuries, we may trace the hand of cultivation spreading
a new aspect over some portion of a planetary surface. Perhaps some large city, the
metropolis of a mighty empire, may expand into a visible spot by the powers of some
future telescope. Perhaps the glass of some observer, in a distant age, may enable him to
construct the map of another world, and to lay down the surface of it in all its minute
and topical varieties. But there is no end of conjecture; and to the men of other times
we leave the full assurance of what we can assert with the highest probability, that yon
planetary orbs are so many worlds, that they teem with life, and that the mighty Being
who presides in high authority over this scene of grandeur and astonishment has there
planted the worshippers of His glory."&nbsp;<a href="#note460"><u>[460]</u></a></p>

<p>How fine is this outburst of the great Scotch orator! He spoke as one inspired with
prophetic foreknowledge; for in less than twenty years after this utterance, Beer and
M&auml;dler published their splendid <i>Mappe Selenographica</i>, or map of the moon; and
photography offered its aid to the fuller delineation of our silvery satellite. Who can
tell what the last fifteen years of this eventful century may develop in the same
direction? Verily these intuitions of reason seem often favoured with an apocalypse of
coming disclosures; and, if we may venture to adopt with slight alteration a sentence of
Shelley, we will say: "It is impossible to read the compositions of the most celebrated
writers of the present day without being startled with the electric life which burns
within their words. They measure the circumference and sound the depths of nature with a
comprehensive and all-penetrating spirit, and they are themselves perhaps the most
sincerely astonished at its manifestations; for it is less their spirit than the spirit
of the age." The poets of science, in their analogies, are "the hierophants of an
unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon
the present."&nbsp;<a href="#note461"><u>[461]</u></a> Equally noble with the language of
Chalmers is a paragraph which we have extracted from a work by that scholarly writer,
Isaac Taylor. He says: "There are two facts, each of which is significant in relation to
our present subject, and of which the first has long been understood, while the latter
(only of late ascertained) is every day receiving new illustrations; namely, that our
planet is, in no sense, of primary importance in the general system, or entitled, by its
magnitude, or its position, or its constitution, to be considered as exerting any
peculiar influence over others, or as the object of more regard than any others. This
knowledge of our real place and value in the universe is a very important consequence of
our modern astronomy, and should not be lost sight of in any of our speculations. But
then it is also now ascertained that the great laws of our own planet, and of the solar
system to which it belongs, prevail in all other and the most remote systems, so as to
make the visible universe, in the strictest sense, ONE SYSTEM--indicating one origin
and showing the presence of one Controlling Power. Thus the law of gravitation, with all
the conditions it implies, and the laws of light, are demonstrated to be in operation in
regions incalculably remote; and just so far as the physical constitution of the other
planets of our system can be either traced, or reasonably conjectured, it appears that,
amid great diversities of constitution, the same great principles prevail in all; and
therefore our further conjecture concerning the existence of sentient and rational life
in other worlds is borne out by every sort of analogy, abstract and physical; and this
same rule of analogy impels us to suppose that rational and moral agents, in whatever
world found, and whatever diversity of form may distinguish them, would be such that we
should soon feel at home in their society, and able to confer with them, to communicate
knowledge to them, and to receive knowledge from them. Neither truth nor virtue is local;
nor can there be wisdom and goodness in one planet, which is not wisdom and goodness in
every other."&nbsp;<a href="#note462"><u>[462]</u></a> The writer of the <i>Plurality of
Worlds</i>, a little work distinct from the essay already quoted, vigorously vindicates
"the deeply cherished belief of some philosophers, and of many Christians, that our
world, in its present state, contains the mere embryo of intelligent, moral, and
religious happiness; that the progress of man in his present state is but the initiation
of an interminable career of glory; and that his most widely extended associations are a
preparation for as interminably an intercourse with the whole family of an intelligent
universe."&nbsp;<a href="#note463"><u>[463]</u></a> Dr. Arnott may add a final word, a
last link in this evidential chain of analogy. He writes: "To think, as our remote
forefathers did, that the wondrous array of the many planets visible from this earth
serve no purpose but to adorn its nocturnal sky, would now appear absurd indeed; but
whether they are inhabited by beings at all resembling the men of this earth, we have not
the means of knowing. All the analogies favour the opinion that they are the abodes of
life and its satisfactions. On this earth there is no place so hot or so cold, so
illumined or so dark, so dry or so wet, but that it has creatures constituted to enjoy
life there."&nbsp;<a href="#note464"><u>[464]</u></a></p>

<p>Here our long list of learned authorities shall terminate. We have strung
together a large number of citations, and have ourselves furnished only the
string. Indeed, what more have amateurs that they can do? For, as Pope puts
it,--</p>

<blockquote>
"Who shall decide, when doctors disagree,<br>
And soundest casuists doubt, like you and me?"
</blockquote>

<p>Besides, astronomy is no child's play, nor are its abstruse problems to be mastered by
superficial meddlers. "Its intricacy," as Narrien reminds us, "in the higher departments,
is such as to render the processes unintelligible to all but the few distinguished
persons who, by nature and profound application to the subject, are qualified for such
researches."&nbsp;<a href="#note465"><u>[465]</u></a> But if professionals must be
summoned as witnesses, ordinary men may sit as jurors. This function we have wished to
fufil; and we avow ourselves considerably perplexed, though not in despair. We hoped that
after a somewhat exhaustive examination, we might be able to state the result with an
emphasis of conviction. This we find impossible; but we can affirm on which side the
evidence appears to preponderate, and whither, we rest assured, further light will lead
our willing feet. The conclusion, therefore, of the whole matter is: we cannot see any
living creatures on the moon, however long we strain our eyes. No instrument has yet been
constructed that will reveal the slightest vestige of inhabitation. Consequently, the
actual evidence of sense is all against us, and we resign it without demur. This point,
being settled, is dismissed.</p>

<p>Next, we reconsider the results of scientific study, and are strongly inclined to
think the weight of testimony favours the existence of a thin atmosphere, at least some
water, and a measure of light and shade in succession. These conditions must enable
vegetables and animals to exist upon its surface, though their constitution is in all
probability not analogous with that of those which are found upon our earth. But to deny
the being of inhabitants of some kind, even in the absence of these conditions, we submit
would be unphilosophical, seeing that the Power which adapted terrestrial life to
terrestrial environments could also adapt lunar life to the environments in the moon. We
are seeking no shelter in the miraculous, nor do we run from a dilemma to the refuges of
religion. Apart from our theological belief in the potency of the Creator and Controller
of all worlds, we simply regard it as illogical and inconclusive to argue that because
organization, life, and intelligence obtain within one sphere under one order of
circumstances, <i>therefore</i> the same order obtains in every other sphere throughout
the system to which that one belongs. The unity of nature is as clear to us as the unity
of God; but unity is not uniformity. We view the whole creation as we view this world;
the entire empire as we view this single province,</p>

<blockquote>
"Where order in variety we see,<br>
And where, though all things differ, all agree."
</blockquote>

<p>And, finally, as analogy is unreservedly on the side of the occupation of every domain
in creation, by some creatures who have the dominion, we cannot admit the probability
that the earth is the only tenement with tenants: we must be confirmed in our judgment
that the sun and the planets, with their moons, ours of course included, are neither
blank nor barren, but abodes of variously organized beings, fitted to fulfil the chief
end of all noble existence: the enjoyment of life, the effluence of love, the good of all
around and the glory of God above.</p>

<p>This article, that the moon is inhabited, may therefore form a clause of our
scientific creed; not to be held at any hazard, as a matter of life or death, or a test
of communion, but to be maintained subject to corrections such as future elucidation may
require. We believe that we are justified by science, reason, and analogy; and
confidently look to be further justified by verification. We accept many things as
matters of faith, which we have not fully ascertained to be matters of fact; but "faith
is the assurance of things hoped for, the proving of things not seen." By double entry
the books of science are kept, by reasoning and demonstration: when future auditors shall
examine the accounts of the moon's inhabitation, we are persuaded that the result of our
reckoning will be found to be correct.</p>

<p>If any would charge us with a wish to be wise above what is written, we merely reply:
There are unwritten revelations which are nevertheless true. Besides, we are not sure
that at least an intimation of other races than those of the earth is not already on
record. Not to prove any position, but to check obstructive criticism, we refer to the
divine who is said to have witnessed in magnificent apocalypse some closing scenes of the
human drama. If he also heard in sublime oratorio a prelude of this widely extended
glory, our vision may not be a "baseless fabric." After the quartettes of earth, and the
interludes of angels, came the grand finale, when every creature which is in heaven, as
well as on the earth, was heard ascribing "Blessing and honour and glory and power to Him
who sitteth upon the throne." Assuredly, our conception of a choir worthy to render that
chorus is not of an elect handful of "saints," or contracted souls, embraced within any
Calvinistic covenant, but of an innumerable multitude of ennobled, purified, and expanded
beings, convoked from every satellite and planet, every sun and star, and overflowing
with gratitude and love to that universal Father of lights, with whom is no parallax, nor
descension, and who kindled every spark of life and beauty that in their individual and
combined lustre He might reflect and repeat His own ineffable blessedness.</p><br>

<p>&quot;When an eclipse of the moon takes place, they attribute it to the moon's
going into their houses, and peeping into every nook and corner, in search of
skins and eatables, and on such occasions accordingly, they conceal all they
can, and make as much noise as possible, in order to frighten away their
unbidden guest.&quot;--<i>Narrative of an

<i>Lord Iddesleigh on the Moon</i>.
</center><br>

<center>
<i>Vide</i> p. 189.
</center>

<p>Speaking at a political meeting in Aberdeen, on the 22nd of September, 1885,
the Earl of Iddesleigh approved the superannuated notion of lunar influence, and
likened the leading opponents of his party to the old and new moon. &quot;What signs
of bad weather are there which sometimes you notice when storms are coming on?
It always seems to me that the worst sign of bad weather is when you see what is
called the new moon with the old moon in its arms. I have no doubt that many of
you Aberdeen men have read the fine old ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, who was
drowned some twenty or thirty miles off the coast of Aberdeen. In that ballad he
was cautioned not to go to sea, because his faithful and weatherwise attendant
had noticed the new moon with the old moon in its lap. I think myself that that
is a very dangerous sign, and when I see Mr. Chamberlain, the new moon, with Mr.
Gladstone, the old one, in his arms, I think it is time to look out for squally
weather.&quot;--<i>The Standard</i>, London, Sept. 23rd, 1885.</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, which is given in the collections of Thomas
Percy, Sir Walter Scott, William Motherwell, and others, is supposed by Scott to refer to
a voyage that may really have taken place for the purpose of bringing back the Maid of
Norway, Margaret, daughter of Alexander III., to her own kingdom of Scotland. Finlay
regards it as of more modern date. Chambers suspects Lady Wardlaw of the authorship.
While William Allingham counsels his readers to cease troubling themselves with the
historical connection of this and all other ballads, and to enjoy rather than
investigate. Coleridge calls Sir Patrick Spens a "grand old ballad."</p><br>

<i>Greeting the New Moon in Fiji</i>.

<p>"There is, I find, in Colo ('the devil's country' as it is called), in the mountainous
interior of Viti Levu, the largest island of Fiji, a very curious method of greeting the
new moon, that may not, as few Europeans have visited this wild part, have been noticed.
The native, on seeing the thin crescent rise above the hills, salutes it with a prolonged
'Ah!' at the same time quickly tapping his open mouth with his hand, thus producing a
rapid vibratory sound. I inquired of a chief in the town the meaning and origin of this
custom, and my interpreter told me that he said, 'We always look and hunt for the moon in
the sky, and when it comes we do so to show our pleasure at finding it again. I don't
know the meaning of it; our fathers always did so.'"--Alfred St. Johnston, in
<i>Notes and Queries</i> for July 23rd, 1881, p. 67. See also Mr. St. Johnston's
<i>Camping Among Cannibals</i>, London, 1883, p. 283.</p><br>

<p>Arnason says that in Iceland &quot;there are great differences between a dream
dreamt in a crescent moon, and one dreamt when the moon is waning. Dreams that
are dreamt before full moon are but a short while in coming true; those dreamt
later take a longer time for their fulfilment.&quot;--<i>Icelandic Legends</i>, Introductory Essay, p.
